  <h1>iMarc.co.uk: Happy Anniversary</h1>
  <p class="meta">22 Jul 2012</p>
  <p>It turns out that this domain <a href="https://nominet.uk/lookup/?domain=imarc.co.uk">imarc.co.uk</a> celebrated its tenth anniversary in April this year. How time flies!</p>
<p>In 2002, the web was a very different place compared with today. The first dot-com bubble had just burst, and there was still far more amateur content online. It was quite common to find personal home pages complete with family photographs or sites devoted to someone’s favourite band. These days, the web is far more corporate, and everything we share is via platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Why is this? Has web design become an elitist art form? Textured backgrounds and blinking text may have looked horrible, but back then it was all about a love of the subject matter, with appearance very much secondary. No one doubts that modern design techniques have improved the look and accessibility of the web, but have they frightened off the average Joe armed only with a copy of FrontPage?</p>
<p>Perhaps the world has simply ‘moved on’, as our favourite Gunslinger once said. People have better things to do than maintain their own sites. Blogging platforms such as WordPress and Blogger offer the ease of use of Facebook while allowing a greater degree of personalisation and independence. Perhaps these days people are writing apps instead.</p>
<p>Or maybe I’m just getting old. Who knows? I’m simply rambling.</p>
<p>Happy anniversary.</p>
