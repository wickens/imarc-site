<p>I'd really like to see mobile operating systems make less of a fuss when you have &quot;<em>Do Not Disturb</em>&quot; switched on. While the feature is a useful one, having a banner across the home screen, or an omnipresent icon at the top of the watch face only seeks to signify that not wanting to be disturbed is an exceptional state, not the norm. The default mode is &quot;<em>Disturb Me</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead, I wonder if the default should in fact be &quot;<em>Do Not Disturb</em>&quot; and that we should have to <em>choose</em> when we want notifications - with options to allow close friends and family to override the setting of course. If someone outside your close circle phones outside of your &quot;<em>Disturb Me</em>&quot; hours, Siri could take the call and inform them of when you'll be available.</p>

  <p>The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/02/scientists-studying-why-gamers-invert-their-controls">reports on a new study</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is one of the most contentious aspects of video game playing – a debate where opposing sides literally cannot see each other’s perspective. When the Guardian ran an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls – meaning that they push their joypad’s thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen – the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am one of those people who cannot play a game without inverting the Y axis. I struggled with early 2000's classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeSplitters_2">TimeSplitters 2</a> because back then there was no systemwide setting to change the preference on PlayStation 2 (though I think the original Xbox had one). Why do I have such a preference? I can only think it's because I used to play a lot of flight simulators, but will keenly await the results of the study.</p>

<p>Kudos to Apple for getting a replacement AirPod Pro out to me within three days of me reporting the fault. Without any notice, a single AirPod arrived at my door in this cute little box. My <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/03/05/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> had developed the <a href="https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues">known fault</a> where one of them (in my case the left one) starts to make a rattling/cracking sound with movement. You can hear it when walking fast, and it's downright horrible when running. I'd also noticed the noice cancellation becoming less efficient, though it was very subtle, I recall having to have the sound much louder in order to hear over traffic.</p>
<p>One tip, if you do get one AirPod replaced then you need to make it pair with your case and the remaining AirPod. To do this, I found I had to unpair the case from my phone, leave the AirPods in the case for a couple of hours <strong>while charging</strong>, and then go through the usual paring process. if I tried to pair before leaving them for a few hours, they just got stuck with a flashing amber light.</p>
<p>So great service from Apple, but I wish they'd just offered to replace both earbuds. It seems likely at some point in the future my right AirPod Pro is going to have the same issue, but for now they are back in business and Apple's 2-year warranty programme will take me through to January 2022.</p>

  <p>After not switching on my Xbox One for a few months, it wouldn't connected to my WiFi. It kept saying &quot;Can't connect to DHCP Server&quot;. Rebooting the router, and forgetting the WiFi network made no difference. In the end, the way to fix it was to <strong>go into my router's network settings, look for the list of devices that had previous connected (and been assigned an IP address), and remove the Xbox from the list. Within minutes, my Xbox was back on the Internet, and downloading updates.</strong></p>

  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">$27.7 billion</a>, or <a href="https://theoverspill.wordpress.com/salesforce-slack-acquisition-start-up-1442#dd20c1ac23517f956ec06ea28296243d">$250,000 per paying user</a>. It's a testament to good product management that Slack has maintained is simplicity in the face of competition from Microsoft Teams. In my experience, Slack's simple emulation of traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> encourages real-time collaboration that is great at the time, but not easy to refer back to after the fact. Microsoft Teams on the other hand presents users with the option of adding a subject line to messages, meaning it gets treated more like email, with threads and replies that can be impossible to follow in real-time. This does however make it easier to find what was said later on.</p>
<p>I don't use CRM Systems on a daily basis, but I have had to work on products that integrate with them. Salesforce is far easier to use and develop for than Microsoft Dynamics, so I think this deal could bode well for Slack users.</p>

<p>It's crazy to see the British tabloids egging people on in trying and find loopholes in the UK Government's Coronavirus restrictions. A better headline would have been &quot;<em>Ignore lightweight Agriculture Minister George Eustice, and keep to the spirit of the rules</em>. <em>Viruses don't care about your intent, technicalities, or what the Government says</em>&quot;. Then again, there's a reason why I didn't go into journalism.</p>

  <p>Lots of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsofts-productivity-score-tool-invades-employee-privacy-2020-11?r=US&amp;IR=T">headlines today</a> about a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/productivity/productivity-score?view=o365-worldwide">feature</a> called <em><strong>Productivity Score</strong></em> that is part of Microsoft Office 365. The service promises to help &quot;<em>organizations transform how work gets done with insights about how people use Microsoft 365 and the technology experiences that support them.</em>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-productivity-score-1.png?w=700" alt=""></p>
<p>While on the face of it, <em>Productivity Score</em> does sound somewhat Orwellian, I think this is down to poor naming. What it really seems to be is a measure of how people use various Microsoft products. If it helps companies measure their ROI on Office 365 and respects privacy, then so be it. While it's possible some gullible manager somewhere might equate software usage to productivity, I have faith that in most organisations this will not be the prevailing view. Productivity is all about efficiency of work produced, and is something that evening leading economists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_paradox">struggle to grapple with</a>. Anyone who has spent more than 10 minutes in a modern workplace will tell you that simply having conference calls and creating Powerpoint presentations does not equate to being productive. Calls, emails, spreadsheets and whatever else <em>Productivity Score</em> measures are byproducts of productivity, not evidence of it.</p>

  <p>In what seems to been an inevitable move in the march of awfulness that is much of the tech industry these days, Spotify has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/">announced</a> that it will be giving artists who pay for the privilege a boost in the algorithm that recommends music to its customers.</p>
<p>For many, especially those who listen to commercial radio, this is probably nothing new. The idea of a record label paying to get their acts in front of more listeners is a pretty standard affair. However, the idea these ads might be sold to customers as a personalised recommendations seems creepy to me. I hope they are clearly labelled as ads, even if the artist having paid for promotion is only one of many inputs into the algorithm that ultimately produces the recommendation.</p>
<p>I never really got on with Spotify's user interface, but I do use Apple Music due to its Siri and Apple Watch integration. The recommendations seem to be very US centric and can be very hit and miss. I've found a couple of new artists via Apple Music, but mostly I find most of my new music via <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_6music">6 Music</a>. I can't see Apple selling out like this.</p>

  <p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/11/staff-who-work-from-home-after-pandemic-should-pay-more-tax">The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Employees who continue working from home after the pandemic should be taxed for the privilege, with the proceeds used to help lower-paid workers, according to a new report. Economists at Deutsche Bank have proposed making staff pay a 5% tax for each day they choose to work remotely. They argue it would leave the average employee no worse off because of savings made by not commuting and not buying lunch on-the-go and fewer purchases of work clothing. Alternatively, the report suggests the tax could be paid by employers who do not provide their workforce with a permanent desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I agree that there is a desperate need to rebalance the economy and ensure that essential workers who often cannot work from home are compensated in such a way that recognises how utterly essential their work actually is, it does seem somewhat shortsighted to me that you would penalise people for being productive at home while also being kinder to the planet and not commuting. For one, buying fewer clothes is a good thing for the planet, though I think most people will find other excuses to buy new clothes.</p>
<p>Many office workers do not buy expensive takeaway food every day as the article suggests. Anecdotally, when we were at the office, I noticed a lot of my colleagues used to simply bring in last night's leftovers in for lunch. Those that do buy lunch every day will likely drive demand in local shops and cafes. Even in lockdown, my local village bakery frequently has people queuing out of the door at lunchtime. All of this is to say that such for some, such a tax could make it more expensive to work from home, especially those who drive to work rather than take more expensive public transport. Do we really want people driving to the office just to save money? Let's hope governments skip past this one, as there are plenty of other ways to increase tax revenue.</p>

  <p>This is a <a href="https://medium.com/computers-are-hard/computers-are-hard-building-software-with-david-heinemeier-hansson-c9025cdf225e">fascinating interview</a> with David Heinemeier Hansson, of recent <a href="https://imarc.me/2020/07/19/hey-dot-coms-attitude-is-a-refreshing-change/">Hey.com</a> fame. He makes the point that when building software, we shouldn't try to estimate features and then fit them into two week sprints. Instead, it should be possible to determine the value of solving a particular problem and then set time boundaries on solving it. The timeframes needn't be short two-week sprints as if often the case in scrum, but something more suited to solving the problem in hand, say 6 weeks.</p>
<p>His central theme is that software is more akin to creative projects like books or movies than big engineering projects like building a skyscraper. While I think there are some interesting ideas here, and as a practitioner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> I am also keenly aware of how easy it can be to become dogmatic about the various ceremonies and systems it advocates so much so that you end up becoming <em>less agile</em>.</p>
<p>That said I think shorter iterations are useful when you are unsure of the value of a certain feature. Building the smallest MVP allows you to test the market in order to determine the value. The idea of setting a time budget and giving the team a couple of months to build out a feature without the overhead and bureaucracy that Scrum entails does seem incising however, and may be appropriate in some cases. I will try to keep this in mind as I develop projects in the future.</p>
