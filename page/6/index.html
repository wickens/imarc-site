  <p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/marc-running.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p><em>That's me (right) - want your logo on display?</em></p>
<p>I am looking for ways to monetise my running.  I usually run 5 kilometres a couple of times during the week and a longer 10 mile (16.10K) run at the weekend. This is a heavy time investment. The 5K runs take between 22 and 30 minutes depending on the weather, my energy levels and the incline of the route. Similarly, the 10 mile run takes usually takes around 1 hour and 26 minutes from my Sunday. This may seem like a small slice of the weekend, but I have to make sure I get up extra early and eat a good breakfast and then wait for a couple of hours before I’m ready to start pounding the pavement. On my return, I need a shower, followed by a long recovery period which involves eating again and then sitting still for a few hours. There are other costs too; a decent pair of running shoes costs between £100 and £120, and only last a year. I could pay less, but I like to support smaller, specialist running shops rather than the likes of Sports Direct. I also need shoes that offer strong support due to the weird way I run which increases the price still. Not forgetting too the copious amount of pasta and other carbohydrates I have to consume. Running costs more than you'd think.</p>
<p>All this has led me to the conclusion that I need to find a way to earn some extra cash from my running.</p>
<p>This post is of course, not at all serious. No, I am not looking for anyone to pay me to do the thing I enjoy. Just as I wouldn’t expect to be paid to go climbing, canoeing, golfing, or to watch a film at the cinema. It’s fine to have an interest that you don’t make money from. I never expect to make money from this blog. It is something I do because I enjoy it. <em>It’s a hobby</em>. I won’t go as far as to say I should be paying <em>you</em> to read it, but I do expect to pay a small amount for WordPress hosting, and to put a few hours a week into writing content.</p>
<p>The reason I’m writing this is because I’ve noticed a theme in various podcasts, blogs and YouTube channels that I've come across recently that some creators who are doing the thing they love and not as their sole means of income are expressing their dissatisfaction at not being able to monetise what is essentially a hobby. I use the term &quot;hobby&quot; not in a derogatory sense - indeed the fact that many creators are not a full on professionals is what gives some of my favourite podcasts and YouTube channels their charm.</p>
<p>Of course I'm not saying creators shouldn't <em>try</em> to make money, and some professionals will of course rely on their creative output as their main source of income. For many of us however, maybe a hobby is just fine? We can't all be <em>The Verge</em>. Just I’m never going to be competing at running with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Farah">Mo Farah</a>, not everyone will end up as successful as the podcast <em><a href="https://atp.fm/sponsor">ATP</a></em>.</p>
<p>If you enjoy the process of creating, and giving something away to an audience, then maybe that's payment enough?</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/5AwdkGKmZ0I?t=723"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/m1-always-on.png?w=1024" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Apple's new M1 Macs use the same 'always-on' processor technology that mobile devices have been using for years. It has always been imperative that a mobile phone must be permanently sitting and listening, waiting for a call or message to come in, so it can sound the ringtone. Modern tablets such as the iPad evolved from this line of thinking and so are naturally <em>always-on</em> too.</p>
<p>Laptops and Desktops have however have never taken this route. Recent versions of Windows and macOS will wake up periodically to perform certain tasks, or in response network events, but I've never noticed them doing much in realtime.</p>
<p>I was surprised then to notice that my new M1 MacBook, while apparently asleep, was busy running rules on incoming mail seconds after it had arrived. My phone buzzes as a new email is received, and I open the mail app on my phone to see the message has been flagged, moved or whatever else I have set as a rule on my Mac. This would happen with my old 2013 MacBook, but the rules would only run every few hours. It's not a bug as far as I can tell, as the battery life when the MacBook is sleeping is still outstanding. I'm yet to explore how this works, or how much 3rd party developers can take advantage of this <em>always-on</em> state, but the possibility of having powerful devices, which aren't locked down in the same way as iPads and iPhones, performing <em>useful</em> tasks in near realtime while using hardly any battery, is pretty exciting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> As of macOS 11.3, Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896">restored hibernation support</a> to M1 Macs. Hibernation mode is a lower power state Mac laptops go into after being asleep for around 3 hours. I’ve not noticed any difference in behaviour yet, let me know about your experience in the comments.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers at Stanford have <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/">identified four causes of what they call &quot;Zoom fatigue&quot;</a></strong>. They all resonate with me as someone who has a lot of online meetings,. (Though I'm not keen on the attempt to turn &quot;Zoom&quot; into a generic noun!)</p>
<p>I recommend reading the article in full, but the four causes boil down to <em><strong>excessive eye contact,</strong></em> <strong><em>always seeing yourself</em>,</strong> <strong><em>reduced mobility</em>,</strong> and <em><strong>higher cognitive load</strong></em> due to the fact it's difficult to interpret body language. The solutions offered range from suggestions on how conference software could be adapted to taking regular &quot;audio only&quot; breaks.</p>
<p>Seeing people is great, and a necessary part of working together, but once the the initial greetings are done, it adds little value most of time, in my experience at least. Thankfully Microsoft Teams lets you hide <em>other people's video</em> as well as your own. Back when I used to work in the office, I would often pace up and down while on calls with clients, and studies have shown we are more intelligent and creative when we're moving. Now though, as the Stanford team point out, we are all sat in chairs, staring at each other directly in the eyes all day.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that video is useful when you're meeting people for the first time and trying to form a connection with them, or for calls where you really want to gauge the other person's true feelings about something. But for meetings that require excessive brainpower or creativity, it's probably worth switching off video and going for a walk.</p>

  </p>

  <p>LastPass made headlines recently because it's stripping back its free offering and asking users to pay for features that were once bundled for free.</p>
<p>I've been a paid LastPass subscriber for over 5 years, and over that time it has become a critical part of both my professional and home workflows. The problem is the issues it had 5 years ago are still problems now. The product seemingly hasn't moved forward much at all. LastPass has a fundamental misunderstanding of basic User Interface design principals. It looks awful and is difficult to use. Each app behaves differently on different platforms, and features are shoehorned in with little regard to the expected user workflow. How many times have I searched for a site, copied the username, only to have to <em>search for the site again</em> in order to copy the password. Errors are frequent, when generating a new password I always end up pasting it into a text editor temporarily in case LastPass fails to save it. It's also incredibly slow, even on 2020 Intel i5 processor.</p>
<p>I mention this because I recently helped a friend migrate from LastPass's free offering to Apple's iCloud Keychain. Compared so LastPass, iCloud is so much <em>nicer</em> to user. I understand LastPass are at a disadvantage in trying to make their product fit into the ecosystems of Apple and Google, but it made me think about switching. Now Apple have made an official way to access <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/icloud/mmfeee20145e/1.0/icloud/1.0">iCloud passwords on Windows</a>, I'm seriously thinking about switching. To their credit LastPass do make it easy to get a CSV export of all your data.</p>
<p>What's your experience with iCloud Keychain? Is it worth switching to from LastPass Premium?</p>

  </p>

  <p>Great <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/yes-chrome-uses-more-ram-than-safari-but-how-much-more/">video by Matt</a> that shows that Chrome isn't always <em>that</em> different to Safari in its memory consumption as others <a href="https://www.flotato.com/post/memory-chrome-safari-flotato">have found</a>. Most of my daily collaboration is done using Microsoft Teams, which is an Electron app - <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/05/microsoft-is-replacing-the-outlook-app-with-a-web-app/">which is to say a web application bundled in its own Chromium wrapper so it can run like a desktop application</a>. I've often noticed Microsoft Teams takes up <em>huge</em> amounts of RAM, especially considering it's not really doing anything that complicated most of the time. A while back I researched phenomena and found this article about <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-memory-usage-perf">how Chromium manages memory</a></strong> on Microsoft's site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chromium detects how much system memory is available and utilizes enough of that memory to optimize the rendering experience. When other apps or services require system memory, Chromium gives up memory to those processes. Chromium tunes Teams memory usage on an ongoing basis in order to optimize Teams performance without impacting anything else currently running.<br>
…<br>
When computers have more memory, Teams will use that memory. In systems where memory is scarce, Teams will use less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put simply, Chrome is taking the idea that <em>'empty RAM is wasted RAM'</em>, and running with it. The article goes on to link to the specific documentation from the Chromium project.</p>
<p>This reminds me of when Windows Vista came out, complete with a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/windows-vista-sidebar.jpg">sidebar full of widgets</a>. One of the default widgets showed CPU and RAM usage. At the time I was working in my local computer retailer, and remember customers being shocked that even with no applications running, Windows Vista was often using 40% of the available RAM, even on higher spec'd machines. Of course Windows was doing a smart thing by pre-loading applications likely to be used into memory so they could be launched faster, and so it was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Chrome's philosophy has long been that <em>it is an operating system for the web</em> - it even has its own task manager. So it makes sense from that perspective to grab as much memory as possible, and use it to speed things up for users. For users who spend most of their day inside Chrome, it's probably doing them a favour. The problem is that these days we often end up running multiple instances of Chrome or Chromium derived apps like Slack or Teams competing alongside each other for system resources.</p>
<p>As Matt shows, the difference between Safari isn't always that much, but the important thing to remember is that Chrome's memory usage will depend on how much overall memory your system has <em>available</em>.</p>

  <p>From <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/23/m1-mac-users-report-excessive-ssd-usage-potentially-affecting-the-components-lifespan/">9to5 Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some advanced users have been reporting an overuse of the SSD for writing and reading data on the newly-released Macs with M1, Apple’s first computer chip based on ARM architecture. The issue could eventually affect the lifespan of the internal SSD used in M1 Macs — not to mention the machine itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My betting is on this being a bug in the software being used to measure SSD usage (a utility called <strong><a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/smartmontools">smartmontools</a></strong> that can be installed via <a href="http://brew.sh"><strong>Homebrew</strong></a>). SSD usage seems like something that should be pretty easy to automate testing for, and so for this to be a bug would be a major omission from Apple's test suite. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/29/macos-high-sierra-bug-apple-mac-unlock-blank-password-security-flaw">Not impossible of course</a>.</p>

<p>Riccardo Mori has written <a href="http://morrick.me/archives/9150">a thoroughly enjoyable critique</a> of the the latest macOS user interface design. This passage in particular made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mac’s user interface is undergoing plastic surgery by the hand of surgeons who have studied on iOS books. The result is pretty much the same as when you see a favourite celebrity after a procedure. They look ‘younger’ but there’s also something weird about their appearance. Their traits have changed a bit. In certain cases you almost fail to recognise the person at first glance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've not upgraded my aging 2013 MacBook Air just yet, but I've experienced Big Sur when briefly using my girlfriend's laptop. I agree there is something that feels slightly 'off' about the new design. Even small details, like the fact that the new control centre glyph looks like a set of miniature switches - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/buttons/switches/">which are a UI components themselves</a>. Whether the new UI will grown on me as iOS 7's did (I was an iOS 6 holdout for many months) will depend on how much Apple refine the new look over the coming months a years, as they did with iOS. Perhaps my <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/22/macos-big-finger/">theory</a> will one day hold true, that Big Sur's big surprise is that it will support touch screens after all.</p>
<p>My fondest memories of Mac OS X was probably Puma. This was a free updated related after 10.0's abysmal stability and performance problems. I remember picking it up for free from John Lewis. (In lieu of an Apple Store - there were none in the UK at the time - they were the one of the few places to get such things.) Back then Mac OS X seemed like a new frontier in user interface design. Here is what 16 year old me's desktop looked like in 2002:</p>

<p>The Fitness app in 2016 vs 2021</p>
<p>Lee asks <em><a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/02/04/are-apple-ruining-user-experience-to-promote-their-own-services/">Are Apple ruining user experience to promote their own services?</a></em> - While using the Fitness app earlier today it occurred to me that the answer is most definitely <em>yes!</em> The current incarnation of the Fitness app (formally known as Activity) now squashes in <em>Activity History</em>, <em>current day</em>, <em>workout lists</em>, <em>awards</em>, and the recently added <em>trends</em> functionality into a single tab. Only <em>Sharing</em> and their brand new premium service, <em>Fitness+</em> get their own tab, and the cynic in me thinks even <em>Sharing</em> is only there because it helps sell Apple Watches to friends and family.</p>
<p>Really, Fitness+ should be its own app, but that would make it easy to delete and forget about. Instead, Apple who were once leaders in user interface design (so much that they call it <em>human interface</em>), are using an entire tab (one whole third of the total tabs) to show a service many people (I'd wager <em>most</em>) won't use. The original app was a joy to use, but the latest one just feels crowded. I hope Apple can find a way to promote services without lowering their famous user experience standards.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2021/02/17/moderating-directories-not-podcasts/">Moderating Directories, Not Podcasts</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    <time datetime="2021-02-17T20:50:44.000+00:00">17 Feb 2021</time>
  </p>

  <p>Great article <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22273071/podcast-moderation-apple-spotify-podbean-steve-bannon?__twitter_impression=true">over on The Verge</a>, but I have one small issue with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking it <em>[Apple]</em> to remove a show from its directory is like asking it to make a specific webpage inaccessible in Safari — is that something people want? Podcasting has, so far, avoided crowning one platform as king, meaning anyone, both on the creator and business side, can enter the space and possibly find success in it. That’s what makes podcasting great, even if it requires unclear answers on moderation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web browser analogy is close - podcasts are just audio files uploaded to web servers - but there's a key difference. Apple (or any company) deciding to not include a podcast in its directory is not the same as blocking its URL outright. It is more akin to Google not showing certain web pages in its search results (which it does all the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">especially in the EU</a>). This is very different to your browser refusing to load a particular web address because the browser maker has decided it doesn't think you should see the content.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the Apple's Podcasts app, you can either search a directory to find a show, or enter its feed URL manually. (Any app that doesn't support adding feeds manually is arguably not a <em>podcast</em> app - I'm looking at you <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Partners-Web-Player-etc/adding-podcast-by-url-why-can-t-spotify-answer-this-question/td-p/4662156">Spotify</a>.) Adding a podcast by URL is how most paid podcasts work, and is the podcast equivalent of typing <em>https://nodejs.org</em> instead of Googling <em>NodeJS</em>.</p>
<p>For better or worse I can see Apple expanding its moderation role for its podcast directory, but just as with the web, eager listeners will always be able to find shows from some other source and enter the URL manually. This is an inherent strength of podcasting, which unlike Twitter and YouTube, is not subject to the same <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/youtubes-recommendation-algorithm-has-a-dark-side/">algorithmic recommendation spirals</a>.</p>

    <time datetime="2021-02-13T18:27:12.000+00:00">13 Feb 2021</time>
  </p>

  <p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the.bbc-domain.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>The BBC has started using its own custom <a href="http://nic.bbc">Top Level Domain (TLD</a>). The entire BBC Online offering is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220112002616/https://the.bbc/">https://the.bbc</a> <em>[Update March 2022 - this link no longer works, so I've updated it with an archive.org link]</em>. Many large corporations such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/tld/">Apple</a> and <a href="http://nic.tkmaxx">T.K. Maxx</a> own their own TLD, which were rumoured to cost around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/icann-to-expand-top-level-domain-names-applications-start-jan-12-2012/?guccounter=1">$185,000</a>.</p>
<p>Currently the site doesn't seem to have officially switched as some components such as video and sign-in appear to be broken, and the site's canonical URL is still set to use the old domain. However the fact that someone has configured the new one along with its own TLS certificate might be a sign that the Beeb is thinking of switching from their iconic <em>bbc.co.uk</em> address.</p>
<p>I suspect for many Internet users of a certain age, the web address <em>http://www.bbc.co.uk</em> was one of the very first they diligently typed into their computer back in the late nineties. The BBC's use of <em>.co.uk</em> paved the way for this TLD to become the de facto for UK-based companies. To switch now may well commence the beginning of the end for <em>.co.uk</em> being the standard for companies in the UK. While not every company can afford the fee for their own TLD, there are now many others, from <em>.mortgage</em> to <em>.furniture</em> to choose from. The problem is few well-known brands actually use them. Perhaps this might change soon.</p>
<p>For me there is something about newer TLDs that make them less likely to stand out as web site addresses. If I saw <em>weather.bbc</em> or <em>visit.london</em> written somewhere, I wouldn't necessarily think to visit them in a web browser, whereas anything ending in <em>.com</em> or <em>.co.uk</em> etc. is obviously a web address.</p>
