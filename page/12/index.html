  <p class="meta">
    <time datetime="2020-03-05T14:06:06.000+00:00">5 Mar 2020</time>
  </p>

  <p>I’ve had the AirPods Pro for just over two months now, so I’m posting my thoughts in the hope that someone might find it useful to get a ‘normal’ person’s review. By ‘normal’, I mean someone isn’t a technology reviewer by profession, and so doesn’t receive the latest gadgets on a weekly basis, and as someone who had to shell out their own hard earned money for the privilege! (On a tangent, there are some great YouTube channels out there reviewing gadgets, but as soon as the creator goes ‘pro’ and suddenly has a £2,000 laptop or £1,200 phone every week, they loose part of what made them interesting, in my humblest of opinions).</p>
<h2>AirPods Classic</h2>
<p>I’ve been using AirPods since 2017 – boy does time fly, it seems like yesterday. I was immediately a fan. The main selling point for me was the fact there was no ‘on/off’ button, and you didn’t need to worry about leaving them switched on. I was forever leaving my other bluetooth headphones powered on and in my bag, and then getting frustrated when Siri didn’t work because it was listening to me through the headset and not my phone’s microphone. AirPods solved this brilliantly. The fact they were such an elegant package, and worked so seamlessly with the Apple Watch was also really cool. I swear running without my brick of an iPhone 8 Plus helps me get a better time. I still use my 2017 ‘original generation’ AirPods regularly, although the battery life is now a little under 2 hours when listening to music, or about 45 minutes if making a call. I can’t help but think the relatively quick degradation of AirPods’ battery compared to say my Plantronics BackBeat FIT (which I’ve had since 2015 and still manage 5 hours) is due to the fact they are constantly charging in the case when not in use. Apple released a feature for the iPhone in iOS 13 that stops your phone from charging all night, in order to lengthen the battery longevity. Using that same logic, being plugged in 90% of the time must take its toll on the AirPods’ battery. Needless to say, the convenience, small size and sheer utility meant I was excited about upgrading the the AirPods Pro.</p>
<h2>Fit &amp; Style</h2>
<p>The biggest noticeable difference with the AirPods Pro is the shape and size. Gone is the long pole that hangs down form your ears. Objectively, the AirPods Pro probably look better than the classic style of AirPods, however the classic AirPods are so ubiquitous now that what once seemed ridiculous now comes across as quite fashionable. If anything, I can see the classic AirPods (which Apple continues to sell) being more popular with younger, more cash-strapped individuals, and consequently more fashionable. Due to their price, AirPods Pro are more likely to be seen on middle-aged IT workers, which may limit their fashion appeal. Despite that, they fit exceptionally well thanks to the three sizes of ear-tips that come in the box, and a built in software utility that helps you to determine if you have a good fit for noise isolation. They are slightly more fiddly to put away than the originals – I find the ear tips often fold inside-out when I remove them from my ears which can be annoying. On the whole though, a better fit means better sounding music. The classic AirPods had terrible noise isolation, so much so that I couldn’t use them on the train in the summer when the windows were open. As a sufferer of tinnitus since I was 23, I am very conscious of not increasing the sound levels on headphones above the EU recommend limit. With AirPods Pro’s more secure fit, I rarely need the volume above 75%.</p>
<h2>Sound Quality</h2>
<p>There’s a lot to be said for the line of thinking that goes: the more you pay for a pair of headphones, the better they sound. Just knowing you have a pair of premium, 24-bit, gold plated headphones can cause a placebo effect in of itself. The AirPods Pro however, do genuinely sound amazing. I’ve heard parts of songs I’d not noticed before: previously hidden rhythm guitar sections, or faint backing vocals. This is on songs I’ve been listening to for 20+ years. The AirPods Pro sound great. The biggest new feature, Active Noice Cancelation (ANC) is extremely good too. I’ve only ever had one pair of noise cancelling headphones before, the Plantronics BackBeat Focus – my office daily driver for Skype Calls. I’d say the AirPods Pro’s ANC is much better, especially considering their small size. I don’t travel often, but I did a short flight recently and was able to listen my AirPods Pro at about 40% volume with ANC switched on which was outstanding. When out and about, Transparency mode does an exceptional job at passing through the sounds of the world around – essentially for walking or running on country lanes against the traffic, as I do frequently. It’s an odd sensation, it seems to slightly increase the higher range meaning you notice the birds singing more than usual. After a while it’s easy to forget you are wearing the AirPods as the outside world sounds so natural, except if it’s windy. I’ve found that running or walking in a breeze does lead to an uncomfortable sensation of of what sounds like someone blowing directly into your ears. I’m surprised there was no way with all the technology onboard this sound could be offset, but I imagine that’s not an easy problem to solve. I hope Apple can improve this with a software update. It’s not a deal breaker, but it’s also not something I’ve ever noticed with other headphones before.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>With the classic AirPods, you could double tap either side to invoke Siri, or trigger play/pause – depending on your configuration. With the new AirPods, double tapping is gone. Instead you need to squeeze the tip. This is more flexible as you can now either press once, twice or three times for play pause, skip forward and skip backward respectively. Pressing and holding switches between ANC and Transparency mode. Overall it’s a better system however I’ve noticed that I often pull the AirPod slightly out of my ear when using this control mechanism, which means I inadvertently loose the seal needed for decent noice cancellation. Siri is as inconsistent as ever. Unlike my OG AirPods, there’s no need to double-tap, I can just shout ‘Hey Siri’. Sometime Siri works like magic – ask it to turn on transparency mode, or lower the volume and 70% of the time it responds instantaneously saying ‘Okay, done’. The rest of the time however, it either takes too long that you doubt yourself – did I say the right thing? – and end up getting your phone out of your pocket, or it gets the wrong idea completely. There is something infuriating about requesting your favourite song, and having your phone proudly inform you it’s going to play a totally different song, from a genre you can’t stand, at maximum volume. Once thing I do notice is you need to say “Hey Siri’ pretty loud. Probably no louder than normal conversation, but louder than I’d like to when I’m in a public place. There’s something about asking your phone to remind you about buying toilet paper, or to send a text your significant other with a question asking them what they want for dinner that means I don’t want to scream it like Dom Joly.</p>
<p>A feature I have enjoyed is one hidden away under the notification settings for iMessage that allows messages to be announced and read by Siri when they arrive. This is genuinely cool, but I’m flummoxed as to why it’s only available on AirPods. Yes you can reply instantly without needed to say ‘Hey Siri’ which requires some clever work by Apple, but I’d be willing to forgo this if I could have this feature in my car too. It’s also of limited use because it doesn’t work with WhatsApp, which is the de facto SMS replacement in the UK.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>I’m very impressed and would recommend them to anyone in the market for some premium headphones. Then again, for a staggering £250, I expect to be impressed. I understand there’s a lot of new technology in these, but I feel £199 would have been more reasonable for something with a 3-year lifespan. The main downside of the AirPods is their limited lifespan. For 2-3 year however, expect to enjoy great sounding music.</p>

  <p>If you're lucky enough to own a smartphone these days, as most people do, then you can most likely use it to replace your wallet. With Apple Pay and Google Pay, you can spend money without the need for cash for bank cards. Store Cards such as Tesco Clubcard can also be placed in your digital wallet. I even store my library card on my phone thanks to <a href="https://www.pass2u.net">this app</a> which lets you digitise any barcode based pass and place it in your Apple Wallet.  I'm so used to this situation now, that I rarely go out with a wallet on my person. Once train ticket machines started taking contactless there really was no need.  One less thing to lose, one less thing to remember. However I ran into a slight hitch the other day when I ordered something online from for pickup in an Apple Store. I placed the order while walking through the shopping centre, knowing the item was in stock and would be ready for me to pick up within 30 minutes.  I paid using Apple Pay on my phone, and an order ticket was placed into my digital wallet. About 10 minutes later a notification appeared on my phone saying it was ready for pickup. Excited, I took the escalator to the upper floor of the shopping mall and walked into the Apple Store, phone in hand, QR code ready on the screen.  All went well until the Apple Store employee asked to see some identification. I had none. Why Would I? I use a digital wallet. In many respects, I am the prototypical Apple Customer, using minimal time from staff and making my purchase online using Apple Pay, from an iPhone. Yet they wouldn't give me my new AirPods without seeing some form of identification. While I understand that you can't just handover expensive items without some kind of validation in place, I was surprised that Apple, of all companies, did not have a digital alternative in place. You could argue it's not the role of Big Tech to be creating digital ID cards, and perhaps there are benefits to plastic-based identification. In the UK, thankfully there are no laws requiring citizens to carry identification (even when driving). That said, I'd love to see a solution that works in tandem with our existing systems and doesn't exclude anyone who doesn't own a smartphone, or wants to keep using plastic ID.</p>

<p>I thought I was just unlucky. It seemed that around 50% of the time I tried to exit a train station by inserting my ticket into the barrier, I'd receive a message asking me to seek assistance. Whether starting or finishing the journey in my local town of Reading or further afield, it seemed to happen very frequently, while everyone else seemed to strut through the barrier with no problem at all.</p>
<p>Today it finally clicked. I've been putting my train ticket in my pocket along with my AirPods. The charging case has the same satisfying click as you close it as a premium brand car does when shutting the door. It achieves this using <em>magnets</em>. My theory is that the magnets are interfering with the magnetic strip on the train ticket.</p>
<p>Paper train tickets probably aren't long for this world anyway, but if you're also experiencing the humiliation of having to speak to an actual human being on your commute, check your AirPods or other devices bearing magnets aren't near your ticket.</p>

  <h1><strong>Volkswagen</strong> taking the <strong>biscuit</strong></h1>
<p>Within weeks of buying my car, a four-year old 2015 Volkswagen Polo 1.2 TSI SE 5d DSG, I discovered that I would occasionally be presented with an error message while driving stating &quot;<strong><em>Error: Workshop! Only leave vehicle in position P.</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/workshop_error.jpeg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Although most of the time the audible tone and error message would disappear within five to ten seconds, it was disconcerting all the same, and a distraction while driving. For a long time I've been a &quot;Do Not Disturb While Driving&quot; convert, making use of iOS's ability to silence notifications while I'm in the car. An alert that beeps and lights up your dashboard with a warning light is dangerous in its own right. If my car incorrectly thinks it's in the workshop, or my gear shift should be somewhere else, that's dangerous too.</p>
<p>Like any good millennial, I googled the error message and quickly found forum posts from other VW owners who'd seen the same message. The consensus was that it was caused by a faulty gear selector, and since it's a known manufacturing fault, the forum posts informed me VW have a service bulletin out and their technicians should be able to identify and rectify the problem swiftly. Knowing I had one year's warranty included with my purchase, I booked my car into the VW garage I'd bought the car from, who after a couple of hours told me they couldn't find anything wrong. They said to see if it happens again and bring it back if it did. They left me their standard complimentary biscuit and I was sent on my way. Surprised by this, but trusting Volkswagen (and enjoying my sugar fix), I went away hoping the error, which had only occurred two or three times, would go away by itself.</p>
<p>Skip forward a few months and the error had reoccurred, and I'd also seen estimates that the cost of a new gear selector could run into the thousands. The error had kept happening every few weeks. At the same time I'd noticed my coolant kept dropping down below it's expected level: I had a slow leak in my cooling system. When I booked this in to get fixed under warranty, I asked them to look at the &quot;workshop!&quot; error too. Again, they found nothing, but did replace my cooling system, over a thousand pounds worth of repairs. Surprising for a car that was only four years old, I was grateful for the warranty and another complimentary biscuit.</p>
<p>A month or two later, the message starting appearing more frequently. I booked it in again, keen to get it resolved before my one year warranty expired (even though as a manufacturing fault, VW should really cover it anyway). This time I told the them there were many forum posts stating it was probably the gear selector, and showed them a video I'd taken of the error (this was difficult to do without breaking the law, but thankfully on at least one occasion the error remained until I was parked off the road and able to take a photo).</p>
<p>After a having the car for a few hours, I was the told the error could be fixed by a software update to my infotainment system, and that as software isn't covered under warranty I'd have to pay a £110 diagnostic fee. Even after explaining the forum posts saying it's the gear selector, they insisted it was a software problem. Not happy about having to pay to fix a fault, I insisted I shouldn't have to pay. The garage wouldn't budge, stating that the warranty only covers mechanical and electrical faults. Even when I explained that software is powered by electricity and so is <em>technically</em> electrical, they refused to waive the fee. In the end I had to phone Volkswagen HQ, and after expressing my frustration and disappointment in Volkswagen in no uncertain terms, they were able to convince the garage to let me off the fee as a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot;.</p>
<p>While doubtful the software update would resolve the problem, I gave the technicals who work for Volkswagen the benefit of the doubt and hoped they had finally fixed this annoying and dangerous error message. I also got a another biscuit.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/biscuit.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>About a week after this, the alert showed again. In fact, it now started showing up more frequently. Sometimes multiple times in one journey, and sometimes not disappearing until I stopped the car and restarted the engine. I phoned Volkswagen again, this time in full &quot;angry consumer&quot; mode and, exacerbated by their inability to fix an issue that a simple web search returns a solution for.</p>
<p>For the fourth time, I dropped my car off. They had preordered a replacement gear selector this time, and so I was quietly confident it would be fixed. About six hours after handing over my car, I received a phone call informing that they had indeed found it was the gear selector and there was even a technical bulletin about this very fault. Thankfully there was no difference of opinion with warranty cover. 10 months into my 12 month warranty, I was reassured.</p>
<p>This was two days ago. I've not seen the message since. My fingers are crossed that this will indeed fix it, but after this experience, in all honesty, I'm not holding my breath. I think they’ve given up with the biscuits now. It’s disappointing but probably better for my health considering how many times I’ve had to go back.</p>
<p>If you experience this error, don’t give up. Mine got worse over time, so get it fixed- no matter how many times they push you away with free confectionary. It’s the gear selector!</p>

  <p>When Apple first announced the AirPods there was a lot of hyperbole in the media about them being Apple's next big 'wearable' device. For a company that <a href="http://fortune.com/2011/03/05/apples-speeds-and-feeds-is-a-preemptive-strike/">famously said that speeds an feeds did not matter</a>, there was a of emphasis on the fact these headphones contained a &quot;W1&quot; chip that could do all sorts of smarts other headphones could not. I use Bluetooth headphones <a href="http://www.lostinlogic.com/blog/2017/04/running-gadgets/">extensively</a>: at work I have a pair of over-the-ear noice cancelling headphones that double up as a headset for making calls. They are excellent at both cancelling the noise around me so I can't hear it when listening to music, and also at removing external noise so other people can't hear me when I'm phoning them. I also use a different pair for running - they are average sound quality, but they are sweat proof and let in external noise making them safe for road-running. Both these headsets have an onboard chip: The big ones I use in the office are able to tell me if I start speaking and my microphone is muted, alleviating the frustration of sharing your greatest idea on a conference call and wondering why nobody even acknowledged you. The sports pair aren't as sophisticated but can tell me how much battery life I have left, telling me there is some smarts going on inside the headphones. So having 'smarts' inside a pair of headphones is nothing new. I'm sure they could come up with a brand name for their silicone chips to, but to me, the W1 in the AirPods is meaningless in of itself. So what makes the AirPods better than any other headphones? It's the integration between hardware and software - Apple's usual strength. In this case not only the integration between hardware and software on the AirPods themselves, but also between the AirPods' software and the iOS device they're paired to. My biggest frustration with existing Bluetooth headphones is that they stay connected to my phone when I'm not wearing them. How many times have I tried to use Siri, and realised after 3 attempts that it's not working because I've left my Bluetooth headphones on and they're still connected but in my gym bag. AirPods solve this beautifully. The other big problem with Bluetooth that AirPods solve is pairing. Recent Bluetooth headphones are not difficult to pair: there's no passcode (it was always 0000 anyway so it seemed pointless) it's just a case of putting the headset into 'pair mode' and then choosing it from the Bluetooth menu. Unless you've paired it with another device since you last used it with the one you're trying to use it with now, in which case you need to un-pair and re-pair. Usually you need to see a few error message before you realise this is the case. This of course means if you want to use them with that other device again you'll need to repeat the process. Not a big hardship, but a small piece of friction that meant I rarely bothered to use my headphones with other devices. AirPods make switching devices as simple as selecting 'Marc's AirPods' from a menu. No pairing, no need to remember about which device I used last. It's not quite as magic as I had hoped for - it doesn't just know I'm using an iPad now and so switch automatically, but hey you can' have everything. So overall I am impressed with my third set of Bluetooth headphones. The AirPods won't replace my headset at work for calls, because I need noise cancelling at work. I will use them for running, walking and working out however. They are especially good around the house while doing chores etc. Their frictionless nature means I'll use them whenever I would have just use the phone's external speaker before. The quality of phone calls is surprisingly low, making me think Apple's switching to a different Bluetooth profile or something. Hopefully this will be fixed in a firmware update. Some other random thoughts: - Siri is pretty unreliable, it's generally not worth the hassle. In the rare case that it understands what I meant, the phone will often respond by displaying an answer on the screen, defeating the point of using the headset. - They seem very secure in the ears. - They look silly, but so did white earbuds when they first came out. - i sometimes feel a bit self-conscious when wearing them, especially if I'm on a train wearing an Apple Watch and reading on an iPad. I feel like I'm in an Apple advertisement (though I'm not good looking enough to actually be in one). - It seems weird that if I go for a run with my Apple Watch, and my iPhone, and use Siri on the AirPods, I can't start a workout using AirPods because they're connected to the phone. This says more about Siri's inconsistencies than the AirPods. - Opening the case near an iPhone causes a menu to show on the phone with details about the AirPods' battery life. It doesn't do this on iPads and Macs, presumably because it needs NFC, which they don't have, but I'm not sure.</p>

  <p>Ever since I was <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2011/08/06/i-did-it-i-bought-an-ipad/index.html">convinced</a> to buy an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/may/28/ipad-regent-street-buyers-survey">iPad</a> 4 years ago, I’ve been a massive fan and predicted they would eventually replace laptops for most consumers. Just as <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130109/steve-jobs-was-right-tablets-are-cars-pcs-are-trucks/">not everyone needs a truck</a>, not everyone needs a laptop right? It turns out however, that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dougolenick/2015/04/30/apple-ipad-shipments-down-23-as-tablet-market-continues-to-lose-steam/">iPad sales are falling</a>. This is more likely a combination of people having much larger phones, iPads being reliable and not needing replacing, lack of innovation (today’s fifth generation iPad does the same as a second generation, only faster), and the fact that the vast majority of consumers don’t need anything more powerful than a phone. It saddens me that despite the Internet being a place where anyone can publish anything at very low cost (or for free in many cases), most people use it to consume TV and post frivolous Facebook updates that don’t require much more than a mobile phone - but that’s another topic altogether. At the other end of the scale you have business and professional users, who tend to use laptops because they offer much more power. Processing power isn’t as far off as you might think, the power difference is now in the software. Take for example a simple task I needed to achieve last week - downloading an MP3 from a web site (legit I might add! It was to accompany a course I was taking) and add it to my iTunes Match Library so it would be available on all of my devices. This is easy to do on a Mac or Windows laptop, but impossible on an iPad. That’s ridiculous. The other software issue that holds back these devices is the transient nature of applications. At any time your application might get terminated due to lack of memory. This rarely results in any loss of work, as developers usually code with this in min (until iOS 4, this happened overtime you left an app). Not many developers both to restore the state of an application (as they are suppose to), and even when they do having to wait for it to load again is painful. So the answer is no, an iPad can’t replace a laptop at the moment. I would like to see Apple push forward with this vision. Why not have a simplified version of Xcode for the iPad? It could be a great way to introduce people to programming (and could feature the Playground function introduced last year). The built in applications should be updated to support ‘Open In’ so I can open that MP3 file in the Music app, for example. For many users, nothing will beat a dual screen setup with a mouse and keyboard - but I can’t help thinking that 90% of my non-work computing needs could be done on an iPad if the software were better.</p>
<h3>Update: 31/5/2015</h3>
<p>I've been using an external keyboard with my iPad a lot recently, so hardware wise it's more on par with a laptop. Here's what I miss most from a full blown Windows/Mac laptop:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to have more than one document open within a single app. Some apps such as Mail support having mutipe drafts open at once, but all the apps I use most frequently such as Microsft Word, Pages and Excel can only open one document at a time. It takes about 30 seconds to close a document and to load another, which just slows me down.</li>
<li>Lack of keyboard shortcuts - such as being able to press 'Enter' to send a message, or CTRL + Enter to send an email. Also being able to switch between documents / apps using the keyboard would help too.</li>
<li>Applications getting unloaded from memory. Or rather lazy developers not bothering to reload the state of an app when it gets reloaded. Again, like with the document switching - it gets in the way when you return to a presentation and find the app has gone back to the open screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>These days, we all carry cameras in our pockets. We can capture and record any event with very little effort and at a moment’s notice. Not surprisingly, a backlash has occurred. (From experience, anything that’s easy and rewarding enough for mass adoption is eventually frowned upon by early adopters.)</p>
<p>People are now criticised for filming events instead of ‘being in the moment’. Kate Bush even banned cameras from her much-hyped comeback shows. Amongst all groups of friends, there’s always the inevitable member who photographs and videos the goings-on (that’s usually me), and while they might seem annoying now, in 20 years' time, when you want to look back, you’ll be glad for their amateur documentaries.</p>
<p>Having recently discovered some videos of my family that were taken in the early '90s (when I was five!), I am firmly of the opinion that it’s our duty to make sure future generations have the opportunity to see such material. Seeing your parents and grandparents as young people really changed my view of them, strangely putting my own life into perspective. While I’m sure future generations won’t care to see a Kate Bush concert that will undoubtedly end up being available to buy anyway, seeing their mum, dad, or uncle dancing, smiling, and enjoying the event would be fascinating.</p>
<p>So, lose your cool and get that camera out. Take that photo. You’ll be glad you did.</p>
<p>(Though I’m still not sure about iPads at gigs.)</p>

  <h2>Incompatible</h2>
<p>I bought my Samsung laptop well over a year ago, and it came running Windows 7. Despite having the most awful keyboard I have ever used, I’ve stuck with it because the Core i5 is pretty decent, and it’s got plenty of storage for all my music and I’m not going to shell out for a new laptop until this one gives up the ghost.</p>
<p>One of the interesting features that Samsung included was a piece of software called ‘Easy Settings’ which allowed me to configure the battery to never charge above 80%, supposedly lengthening the life of the battery. I turned this on (since my laptop is plugged in 99% of the time) and forgot all about it. A few months later I installed Windows 8 and found that Easy Settings no longer worked. When I tried to install it I got this message:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/82fc1-image.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/e725b-image_thumb.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>Loosing 20% of your battery capacity might be fine around the house, but sometimes I do like to take my laptop out and so I really wanted to be able to configure this. Even forcing Windows to install meant the app would run but wouldn’t display correctly function at all, I guess Microsoft blocked it for a reason.</p>
<h2>Install Version 2.1</h2>
<p>It turns out <a href="http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/SW/201305/20130521090434453/SWUpdate_2.1.15.1.ZIP">Samsung do offer a version of this tool for Windows 8</a>, they just don’t make it easy to find. Version 2.1 works perfectly fine on NP300E5A model. Before I could change any power management settings, I had to update my laptop’s firmware however. The link to the download was hidden away on this <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/win8upgrade/">Windows 8 update page</a>, so check your model is listed before performing any firmware updates!</p>

<p>One nice addition if the ability to turn your laptop into a wireless Access Point (yes, Macs have had this feature for years I know, and it’s very useful).</p>

  <p>A few weeks ago, the iPod turned 10. Hard to believe I know, at the time I’d just recently been bought an iMac (of the original curvy variety) and so I was keeping a close eye on all things Mac (only my AOL dialup connection). I remember reading about the announcement of the iPod and thinking “<em>Wow!”</em> – and feeling pretty smug because as a Mac user I would be able to get one (they were Mac-only to begin with). Of course at the age of 16 £300 for a gadget is hard to come by and so I wait until that Christmas and to my surprise I had an iPod in my stocking.</p>
<p>What struck me was the simplicity and purpose the device was beaming with, it integrated with iTunes so well and songs transferred across at lightening speed. Before the iPod I had been using an MP3 CD player which was a nightmare to navigate, and exceptionally bulky. I was getting the bus to college daily, and I remember I would have to pack it up the stop before because listening on the move wasn’t really an option due to it’s general bulkiness.</p>
<p>Any music player is pretty useless without good music to put on it, at the time I remember listening to Turin Brakes’ debut album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Optimist_LP">The Optimist LP</a>. Even today when I listen to this album, I am reminded of the novelty of the first iPod (as well as standing in freezing January weather waiting for a bus).</p>
<p>Apple released various updates, to support AAC and improve battery life – but the iPod remained the same essentially, a beautiful music player.</p>
<p>By about 2004 my iPod was well and truly battered, this was before it was common knowledge that that “durable” metal back was also very stretchable. I decided to move to a HP PocketPC running Windows Mobile 4, with a 500MB Compact Flash Card. It was nowhere near the 5GB of the iPod, but the geek in me wanted something that could play video and surf the web (using IrDA and GPRS). It was a functional little device, but shoddily built. In 2006 I decided to get an iPod Video 5.5. By now Apple had moved well and truly away from the physical scroll-wheel to a touch-sensitive one – I still use this iPod today and I have never managed to get on with it as well as the first iPod. The video was great though, and the battery was even better. I remember it got me through the hours I had to sit in LAX when my flight was cancelled. That trip was to New York in 2007, a few months after the release of the iPod Touch. After visiting the Apple Store on 5th Avenue, I couldn’t resist the spending my entire holiday money on one of the things and promptly purchased an iPod Touch.</p>
<p>The first generation iPod touch was all about music, and being able to buy it online wherever you were – there were no games, no apps, you couldn’t even edit calendar appointments – this was all about the music (and video). It was therefore a nice addition when Apple released an update (I think it cost about £5) that gave users the ability to install apps.The iPod Touch was also the first time I had ever used a mobile browser and actually enjoyed the experience. My phone at the time (a Nokia N95) was a great phone, but browsing the web it it was awful.</p>
<p>The iPod Touch, like the iPod Video I own remains in use today (I have passed it down the family). Shocking when you think since 2008 I have had 2 laptops fail on me yet these devices still work perfectly. The original iPod powers up, but the battery only lasts a few minutes, and I don’t have a PC with FireWire to get songs onto it anymore</p>
<p>So just some of my iPod memories! I wonder what I’ll be using in 10 years time?</p>

  <p>I have been tempted by the iPad for a while now, it seemed to offer the power of a laptop without the inconvenience of a laptop. A long battery, yet always connected and always on. I knew full well about the downsides and I didn’t expect to be typing large documents on it, but for browsing the web, checking email and chatting on instant messenger it seemed perfect. So was it?</p>
<h2>Not prefect, but very good</h2>
<p>The iPad 2, despite considerably lower specs than my laptop on paper feels snappy and rarely do I have to wait for anything to happen. Unlike a laptop, there is no fan – so I feel comfortable leaving it on my bed, or on the carpet knowing I’m not to come back and find it with fans whirling while it melts. The device seems durable, whereas the iPod has a an easy-to-scratch surface, the iPad won’t get scratched under normal use.</p>
<h2>Lack of apps</h2>
<p>One thing I have found is the lack of iPad specific apps. It’s still quite a new platform, so I can forgive app developers slightly – but the big hitters such as Spotify and Audible still make you use the iPhone versions of the app, which only work in portrait mode and look pixelated. The keyboard layout is also different for iPhone apps, which is rather confusing. While I can type pretty fast on the iPad, the lack of any blogging software as good as Windows Live Writer means I still prefer to fire up my laptop to write anything substantial. An iPad version of Google Chrome would be nice, or at least a way to sync your Google Chrome bookmarks easily (it can be done now, but involves using a 3rd party service and isn’t worth the hassle in my opinion).</p>
<h2>Quality not quantity</h2>
<p>Having said all that, the apps that come with the iPad are of a very high quality. The Mail, Calendar and Contacts app are very impressive. I was surprised Apple didn’t include an alarm clock and weather app, seeing as there is one available for the iPhone but it’s not a big deal as 3rd party apps have filled the gap.</p>
<p>For casually browsing the web or responding to emails, iPad wins. Booking a holiday? Then I’ll want 30 tabs open at once, and the iPad isn’t good at context switching. Overall I am impressed, it really does fill the void between a smartphone and a laptop. Tablets won’t replace laptops in my opinion, but they will take on many of their roles relegating laptops to the more comprehensive tasks.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>
