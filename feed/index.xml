      <title>Virtual Private Nonsense</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Adverts for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are now a regular feature on many podcasts. A common theme I’ve noticed is the attempt to justify using a VPN by claiming that public WiFi networks are inherently unsafe without one. Take this <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-scent-of-humane/id918152703?i=1000709986055&amp;r=4716">recent example</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes, hotels, airports, your online data is not secure. Someone on the same network can gain access to your information, passwords, bank logins, credit card information, and other things that you don't want in someone else's hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <strong><em>absolute nonsense</em></strong>. Yes, it's true that if the WiFi network doesn't require a password to connect to, then your data will be sent in the clear and could theoretically be accessed by anyone, as made famous by the app <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep">Firesheep</a>. This was in 2010 however. In fifteen years since then, and the twelve years since the Snowden leaks, the vast, vast majority of websites have adopted their own encryption to protect data in transit. Even before then, any reputable site handling sensitive information (such as online banking or payment processing) was already using TLS (Transport Layer Security). In 2025 (and really for the past decade), you do not <strong><em>need</em></strong> a VPN when on public WiFi.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the WiFi network is encrypted, there are inherent risks in connecting to a network you can't necessarily trust. Most devices have built in firewalls to mitigate this. As long as that's switched on, you're probably going to be OK.</p>
<p>So why would anyone use a VPN? As far as I can tell there are only three reasons why anyone would use a VPN:</p>
<ul>
<li>To access protected network resources — it's common for companies to require employees to be on a VPN before they can access sensitive resources as an additional security layer.</li>
<li>To fake your location — Netflix and many other streaming platforms often offer better content in different regions, or perhaps you simply want to access BBC iPlayer while you're abroad.</li>
<li>To conceal your IP address — for instance, if you're involved in illegal activity or working as a journalist needing anonymity.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would not hesitate to use online banking over Starbucks WiFi. In fact, I’d be more worried about someone peering over my shoulder than any threat from the network itself.</p>
<p>So don’t be taken in by the scaremongering ads. The chances are, you don’t need a VPN.</p>
<p>But if you’ve got another reason for using one, let me know in the comments below.</p>

      <title>Microsoft AI Gimmicks Risk AI Fatigue</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2025/05/24/microsoft-ai-gimmicks-risk-ai-fatigue/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-actions.png.webp?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Microsoft, in its ongoing quest to make Windows 11 feel increasingly clumsy and tone-deaf, has now decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670251/microsoft-windows-11-ai-actions-file-explorer-context-menu">add a new “AI Tools” menu to Windows Explorer.</a> One can almost picture the product management meeting, where some directive from on high decreed: “We must be seen to be using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672984/microsoft-notepad-paint-snipping-tool-generative-ai-windows-insiders">AI in everything</a>, everywhere and all at once.”</p>
<p>While they may have a tendency to over-explain the obvious (as shown by <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/new-user-experience-for-consumer-authentication/3822035">this 1,000+ word blog post just to say they’re replacing passwords with PassKeys</a> – something that could be summarised in a single paragraph), the decision to lump a collection of seemingly unrelated features into one menu simply because they involve “AI” suggests either a complete absence of user centric thinking or a rather desperate attempt to appear as an AI leader.</p>
<p>The screenshot shows four menu items. The first, “Visual Search with Bing” (one can only imagine how many bureaucrats had to approve that name), allows you to search the web using something similar to Google’s reverse image search or Apple’s Visual Lookup. The other three are image editing tools: one for adding a background blur (which uses AI to detect the main subject in an image and blur everything else), one for erasing objects (where AI estimates what would be behind the removed element and fills it in), and one for removing the background entirely (essentially the same as the blur tool, but deleting the background pixels instead of blurring them). There’s also another totally separate “Ask Copilot” menu, which presumably also uses AI, but I’m guessing this was built by another team which would explain why it’s in a totally different place in the context menu.</p>
<p>All of these features are genuinely useful, and it’s great to see them included in Windows (presumably using on-device processing rather than relying on the cloud). However, grouping them under an “AI Tools” menu doesn’t make much sense. “AI” in this context means machine learning-based processing and is becoming as commonplace as traditional processing tasks. Designing a user interface around the underlying technology rather than the user experience is a fundamental mistake. That's not to say a UI shouldn't ever mention &quot;AI&quot; – it is important to let users know when AI (especially generative AI) is going to be used or was used, as it provides a useful prompt to scrutinise the output more carefully and helps set expectations. But Microsoft’s overuse of it just makes them seem a little desperate to be seen as jumping on the AI bandwagon and risks users switching off every time they see yet another &quot;AI&quot; feature.</p>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of Vector Databases</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2025/05/05/the-rise-and-fall-of-vector-databases/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jobergum/status/1872923872007217309">Jo Kristian Bergum on Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This surge was partly driven by a widespread misconception that embedding-based similarity search was the only viable method for retrieving context for LLMs. The resulting &quot;vector database gold rush&quot; saw massive investment and attention directed toward vector search infrastructure, even though traditional information retrieval techniques remained equally valuable for many RAG applications. … However, the landscape has evolved rapidly. What started as pure vector search engines now expand their capabilities to match traditional search functionality. Vector database providers have recognized that real-world applications often require more than just similarity search.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve never quite understood the hype around using similarity search to retrieve content for a RAG system. Yes, cosine similarity can be useful in certain situations, but in many cases, there are better ways to find the right content. This is especially true when the user’s question has little semantic resemblance to the answer. Not to mention when you have potentially multiple versions of the same documents that may or may not be relevant depending on the context of the question. Now every major database supports vector search, is there even a need for a dedicated product? I’d recommend giving the latest episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/latent-space-the-ai-engineer-podcast/id1674008350?i=1000705713887">Latent Space</a> podcast a listen where they explore these issues, and alternatives, in more depth.</p>

      <title>Apple’s Notification Summaries: Why Starting Small Still Matters in AI</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/e453dc00-bdeb-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.png?w=1024" alt="A iOS notification summary from BBC News that reads Luigi Mangione shoots himself; Syrian mother hopes Assad pays the price; South Korea police raid Yoon Suk Yeol's office.&quot;"></p>
<p><em>Image source: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2v778x85yo">BBC News</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2v778x85yo">Graham Fraser reporting for BBC News</a> about Apple's new notification summarisation feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A major journalism body has urged Apple to scrap its new generative AI feature after it created a misleading headline about a high-profile killing in the United States.<br>
The BBC made a complaint to the US tech giant after Apple Intelligence, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to summarise and group together notifications, falsely created a headline about murder suspect Luigi Mangione.</p>
<p>The AI-powered summary falsely made it appear that BBC News had published an article claiming Mangione, the man accused of the murder of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. He has not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve worked on implementing AI into software products for the past seven years, and the first rule is always to start with a narrow domain, carefully assess how effective it is, and, if your approach is working, gradually expand your domain coverage. When it comes to notification summaries, I can’t help but wonder why Apple didn’t adopt this approach. Instead, they’ve delivered something that feels more like a hasty student project than the polished innovation we’ve come to expect.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would have started by limiting the product to summarising notifications where summaries are genuinely most useful. Of course, not being a product manager at Apple, I haven’t done the research, but let’s assume messaging apps would top the list. A &quot;TL;DR&quot; summary for lengthy WhatsApp group chats, for instance, could be genuinely valuable. On the other hand, attempting to summarise product promotions or delivery notifications from Amazon, breaking news, or even the alerts I get when my wife logs a feed on our baby-tracking app feels far less useful. Most of the complaints I’ve seen online seem to involve apps like BBC News, Amazon, or other non-communication apps. Apple would be better off avoiding attempts to summarise these types of notifications and instead focusing on apps where summarisation truly adds value: messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Slack.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the current implementation is flawless when it comes to messaging apps either. In an example shared by <em>WSJ</em> technology journalist Joanna Stern, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@joannastern/post/DCezF5pRbjM">the iPhone mistakenly assumed her wife was referring to a non-existent husband</a>. The issue likely arose because Stern has her wife saved as “Wife” in her address book. The smaller language model onboard the iPhone, relying on statistical assumptions, concluded that someone called “Wife” must be referring to a husband when mentioning another unnamed person. It’s exactly the sort of edge case<a href="#835b0802-a0c7-4b2f-8d5a-37d7a5a1be2d">1</a> that could have been caught more easily during testing if the first version had maintained a laser-like focus on summarising messaging app content.</p>
<p>By starting small and focusing on where summarisation adds the most value, Apple could have delivered a more refined and impactful feature, avoiding many of the issues we've seen reported .</p>

      <title>On MKBHD’s New App</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/panels">John Gruber writes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253023/mkbhd-panels-wallpaper-app-response-criticism">A swing-and-a-miss from MKBHD</a>. Criticism of the app is on two separate levels, but they’re being conflated. Level 1: the app is not good. Level 2: <em><a href="https://x.com/_ali_taylor/status/1838655765730726172">a paid wallpaper app</a>? — LOL, wallpapers are free on Reddit</em>. That second form of criticism — that there shouldn’t even exist a paid wallpaper app — is annoying and depressing, and speaks to how many people do not view original art as being worth paying for. But it also speaks to the breadth of Brownlee’s audience, which I think is more tech-focused than design-focused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s even more annoying and depressing is the inability to separate the appreciation of art from the act of commerce. Perhaps people didn’t expect someone reportedly already making millions to charge so much for so little. The app description mentions &quot;teaming up with top-tier digital artists,&quot; so it’s not as if it’s even showcasing lesser-known artists who might benefit from the app's exposure and thus warrant some philanthropy. Gruber is wrong here. You can appreciate good design while also thinking £12/month is a rip-off.</p>

<p>I was recently trying to compile a .NET project as a self-contained binary for <code>linux-arm</code> to run on my Raspberry Pi. When trying to run the binary, I kept getting the following error:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found (required by ./[executable])
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out the issue was caused by using .NET 9. <strong>Downgrading the project to .NET 8 resolved it</strong>. I'm unsure whether Microsoft or Raspbian needs to address compatibility with .NET 9, but as it didn't impact my code, it wasn't a problem for me.</p>

      <title>Apple Vision Pro…blematic</title>

<p>Image credit: Apple (<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/</a>)</p>
<p>Three and a half months after the release of Apple Vision Pro, and I am finding it difficult to get on board with Apple's vision for the future of computing. While admittedly I haven't tried the Vision Pro due to it not being available in the UK, and I'm sure I would be momentarily wowed by the experience, I just can't get excited about what I see as a deeply dystopian vision of the future.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the vision itself. We spend too much time on screens as it is. Endless doomscrolling and the inability to switch off are widely believed to be behind rising anxiety and depression. Apple, to their credit, has attempted to remedy this with features like Screen Time which allow limits to be put in place. The very concept of the Vision Pro goes against this progress. It's a screen strapped to your face. Right now, the discomfort of a hot and heavy device acts as a deterrent against using it too much. My worry is that as technology progresses and much like the smartphone, the Apple Vision Pro will get lighter and more comfortable — more addictive. If the headset follows the path of the smartphone, then it will eventually be something we want to wear as much as possible. We live in a world of filter bubbles. If you use Twitter (sorry, X), then your view of reality can be vastly different from your next-door neighbour who also uses Twitter, due to the fact that you both like and follow totally different posts and sets of people. Smaller social networks don’t need an algorithm to do this as they will typically only attract people of a certain political leaning in the first place. The end result is the same. Filter bubbles are an obvious problem for social cohesion, and while they are not limited to social networks (hello Fox News), I can’t help thinking that when literally everything is viewed through a screen — yes, your entire reality — the problem will only get worse. If you've seen Black Mirror, then I don’t need to explain why, but let me anyway. Imagine an app for a future revision of Vision Pro (or its rivals) that can be worn all day. The app allows users to employ Twitter-style blocking, so the faces of people they would rather not see are blurred out. Could someone with right-wing views use an app to blur out TV screens showing CNN or the front page of the New York Times, allowing them to walk down the high street and not be bothered by reality, or what they consider dissenting opinions? In 2020, as California was struck by awful wildfires, people noticed something strange. Their smartphones were automatically adjusting the apocalyptical red-tinted sky to look more “normal.” The image of humans using VR goggles to deny climate change or insert virtual green spaces into an otherwise industrial wasteland is just terrifying. In short, I am deeply worried about a future in which our entire reality is seen through the filter of a screen. The Apple Vision Pro can’t do any of this right now, and I doubt Apple would ever allow it to. Yet as the Twitter/Musk debacle shows us, the people who run companies can change, and their policies with it. Not to mention that if the Apple Vision Pro were to be a success, then there would naturally be rival products released which may not be as restrictive.</p>
<p>All of what I’ve said so far is admittedly far-fetched, and perhaps assumes the worst of humanity. So let me focus on the Apple Vision Pro as the product it is today. Apart from being deeply antisocial, the main problem I see is that it is an iPad strapped to your face but priced as if it were a fully-featured MacBook strapped to your face. The iPad and tablets, in general, are great content consumption devices, but the limitations inherent in mobile operating systems make them poor substitutes for a laptop. Samsung and Apple have taken steps to address this, including making the iPad more like a laptop with the addition of support for trackpads, mice, and keyboards. Yet the apps themselves are more often than not baby versions of the same applications available for desktop operating systems, if an app is available at all. There are exceptions — Logic and Final Cut Pro. Overall, it seems a combination of iOS (sorry iPadOS) limitations, Apple’s greedy business practices, and the poor ergonomics of tablet devices has contributed to the iPad not taking off in a productivity context, outside some niche verticals. By designing the Apple Vision Pro’s software stack in the image of the iPad, the device is unfortunately severely limited. Had the device been based on macOS, with the ability to run Mac software, then it would be a completely different story. I understand that technical limitations likely prohibit this: the accuracy of Vision Pro’s gesture recognition simply isn’t good enough to allow Mac apps designed for use with a mouse to be comfortably driven. Which brings me to my final criticism. One of the most touted features of the Vision Pro is the ability to VNC into a desktop Mac and control it remotely. The fact that this was pushed as a feature is the most damning indictment of the Vision Pro’s capabilities as a computing device. A proper computing device worth its $3,500+ price tag wouldn’t need the ability to remotely connect into your other $2,000+ laptop — it would be as capable itself. On various forums I’ve seen happy Vision Pro customers tout the ability to work on a plane for hours on end with both their MacBook and Apple Vision Pro. Here we go again with the dystopian future: can someone not take a flight for a few hours without needing to be productive? For goodness' sake, read a book, listen to a podcast, or just look out of the window!</p>
<p>So, while the nerd in me is ready to be wowed by the Apple Vision Pro, I find myself despairing as I think about a potential future where we are always plugged in, online, and unable to escape work. I can’t help but think this isn’t what technology was supposed to be about. I have to ask myself, would the figure from Apple’s famous 1984 commercial who throws a sledgehammer at the big screen be wearing an Apple Vision Pro, does the screen itself represent Apple latest Vision?</p>

      <title>Microsoft: This Feels Desperate Now</title>

      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2024/02/25/microsoft-this-feels-desperate-now/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/microsoft-edge-dark-pattern.png?w=268" alt=""></p>
<p>Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica has written a nearly 3,000 word article explaining <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">how to remove advertisements and other annoyances from Windows 11 and Microsoft Edge</a>. Microsoft are not alone in degrading the quality of their software in order to sell more services, <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/18/squashing-services-into-apps/">Apple has been doing this as lot recently too.</a> With Microsoft though it feels increasingly desperate. Its Copilot feature acts like a thin wrapper around the OpenAI API, no doubt created in order so that Microsoft can be seen as fully riding the LLM bandwagon. Of course the resulting stock price bump from this perception was probably factor here as well. Its garish icon is placed on the taskbar by default, yet has no intuitive way to be removed. You'd think would be able to simply right-click and unpin it like any other icon, right? Of course not. Instead, you have to dig around in the system settings app. Either their UX designers are bad at their jobs, or more likely a manager stepped in and said <em>&quot;Actually, let's enhance the friction in removing the icon; my forthcoming bonus hinges on maximising user engagements with it. (evil laugh)&quot;</em></p>
<p>The same is true in Microsoft Edge. Any setting that Microsoft would rather you didn't change is unbelievably difficult to find. Want to remove the side bar, or change the default search engine from Bing? One might think, perhaps naively, that altering something as basic as the default search engine shouldn't require a degree in computer science. Yet, here I am, resorting to the wisdom of Google search to uncover the elusive setting (I did try asking Microsoft Copilot, but alas, it came back with something completely unrelated). Edge is also desperate for me to make it the default browser. Instead of cutting to the chase, it dances around like a slick sales rep, coyly offering me the choice of &quot;Microsoft's Recommended Settings&quot; as if I'm choosing to enhance my computer security, when really it's more about padding Microsoft's bottom line.</p>
<p>I suppose we should be grateful for Microsoft at least offering settings for these options - there's no reason they have to. Microsoft's strategy seems to be a delicate balancing act between making it difficult for the masses and maintaining some appeal for the more tech-savvy who would switch to another vendor if they didn't have these options at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a desperate look. Please Microsoft, show some class!</p>

      <title>Fixing Focus Modes on iOS</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/12/03/fixing-focus-modes-on-ios/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 11:50:19 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/12/03/fixing-focus-modes-on-ios/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When Apple introduced Focus <em>Modes</em> and Focus <em>Filters</em>, I hoped it might finally mean the ability to cleanly separate work and personal life within iOS. Unfortunately, the system is flawed.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly recap on how it works. Focus Modes are an extension of “Do Not Disturb” which has been with iOS since version 2011 (if my memory is correct) and allow precise control of notifications for different scenarios. Apple allows users to create various focus modes for different activities. For each focus mode, you can control who and which apps are allowed to send notifications. Apple ships iOS with several default modes such as “Sleep”, “Work”, and “Reading”. For example, I might turn off Slack notifications in the “Personal” Focus Mode, and then schedule that to activate in the evenings.</p>
<p>Focus filters on the other hand control which data is available inside apps and are linked to a particular Focus Mode. For example, for to-do list app that allow you to create different lists, you could use Focus Filters to hide your shopping list when the “Work” Focus Mode is activated, and then hide your work tasks while your “Personal” Focus Mode is activated.</p>
<p>The problem with Apple’s implementation is that it always requires a particular Focus Mode to be activated. There is no way to apply Focus Filters or control notifications when no Focus Mode is activated. Additionally, Focus Modes and Focus Filters are literally <em>filters</em>. This means they can only reduce content that is already enabled. In my use case, I want to turn off my work email and calendars by default but have then enabled during work hours. I want to disable Slack Notifications all the time, except during work hours. This is simply not possible with iOS and represents a fundamental flaw in the design. I can of course disable Slack Notifications fully, but then I can’t enable them for a particular Focus Mode. I could also painstakingly configure focus modes to consume contiguous time blocks throughout the day, but this is error prone and there are times when a focus mode gets switched off for some reason and I’m inundated with notifications I don’t want. The Apple Watch is also unaware of Focus Filters and will happily show calendar appointments despite the same appointments being filtered out on my Phone.</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure how Apple missed the obvious on this one. Perhaps they are stuck dealing with technical debt and the current system is a compromise based on what is technically achievable. Perhaps they genuinely think the current system is adequate. Perhaps I’m the outlier. Either way, I hope they address this issue. Currently, iOS still makes it far too difficult to separate work and personal content.</p>

      <title>Why Is My Apple Watch Not Charging to 100%?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/10/13/why-is-my-apple-watch-not-charging-to-100/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 10:31:27 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/10/13/why-is-my-apple-watch-not-charging-to-100/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple have recently introduced a new featured called &quot;Optimized Charge Limit&quot; which aims to lengthen the lifespan of the battery embedded within an Apple Watch:</p>
<p>From Apple's support pages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With watchOS 10, this feature is available on Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 6 and later, and Apple Watch Ultra and later. Optimized Charge Limit learns from your daily usage to determine when to charge to an optimized limit and when to allow a full charge. Optimized Charge Limit is on by default when you set up your Apple Watch.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213338">Apple support documentation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feature builds on the existing optimised charging feature found on the Apple Watch and most <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/23/airpods-now-less-disposable/">other Apple devices</a>. Now though, if the watch notices that you typically only use, say 30% of the battery capacity on a daily basis, but still charge it every night, then instead of charging it to 100% it might stop short at say, 70% instead. Lithium iron batteries don't like to be charged above 80% or below 20%. Doing so frequently will shorten the lifespan of batteries, making a <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2022/10/13/how-a-battery-replacement-left-my-apple-watch-obsolete/">dreaded replacement</a> necessary.</p>
<p>Hopefully the algorithm employed by Apple is smart enough to work out your routine, and so if it notices you usually go for a long run on a Tuesday morning then it will give you a full charge the night before.</p>
<p>This is a much needed new feature as the tiny batteries in Apple Watches are more prone to the effects of aging than larger devices. Their small capacity means a slight decrease in capacity will have a notable effect, and also mean users are likely complete a greater number of charge cycles over a shorter time than on say an iPhone or MacBook.</p>
<p>That said, the feature is it is perhaps not <em>visible</em> enough. Various technical support forms and subreddits have been flooded with people who think their watch is malfunctioning. As is often the case with Apple, you are probably best off simply not looking at the battery meter and just using the watch. If you do notice the battery is not fully charged but think you might need it to be, the support document details how to temporarily disable the feature (note, you need follow the instructions while the watch is connected to power).</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a disappointing move, Microsoft have <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/">discontinued Visual Studio for the Mac</a>. This comes not long after they <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2022/05/25/vs-2022-for-mac-ga.aspx">rewrote</a> the user interface to be faster and more fluid using native frameworks. Given the depressing state of Windows these days, the lack of a full-featured IDE does not bode well for the long-term future of .NET and other related technologies. For many years, Windows has seemed stuck in limbo. Adding pointless features like Dark Mode, but still with nowhere near the number of productivity features Mac users take for granted. I had considered VS for Mac somewhat if a lifeboat for .NET developers wanting jump ship from Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/feb/09/nokia-burning-platform-memo-elop">burning platform</a>.</p>

      <title>watchOS 10: Peaks and Troughs</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/10/08/watchos-10-peaks-and-troughs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/10/08/watchos-10-peaks-and-troughs/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/watchos-10.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Another year and <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/27/watchos-7-after-five-years-the-apple-watch-is-hitting-its-stride-but-at-what-expense/">another update</a> to the venerable operating system that runs on millions of watches is here. This time though, it’s a mixed bag. It’s easy for us technology enthusiasts become complacent about the fact we get new features released each year for ‘free’. There is though unwritten contract between Apple and its user base that these free updates won’t regress the product that was originally purchased. Unfortunately that’s not the case with watchOS 10. While there are some fantastic new features, the overall quality appears to have dropped significantly.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the good. The new design is a welcome change. Having dropped the original 42/38mm watches, Apple have been able to stretch their design muscle and rethink many of the core apps. Stalwarts like Activity (which incidentally has not been renamed to Fitness like its iOS sibling - <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/18/squashing-services-into-apps/">a plus in my view</a>) now look much more modern, though there is still no way to see a map of a run or cycle on the watch itself - surprising considering the Apple Watch has shipped with a maps app since day one. The Fitness app remains the same, but now asks for confirmation when ending a workout. After eight years of not requiring one and having recorded workouts nearly every day of those eight years, this will definitely take some getting used to. The Weather app looks great, taking inspiration from its iOS counterpart. Overall, Apple have done a fantastic job with the new design.</p>
<p>My favourite new feature is <em>widgets</em>. It’s now possible to scroll the digital crown or swipe up from the main watch face and see a list of customisable widgets. The nicely solves the problem of watch faces being severely limited with space and the fact that many of the nicest looking watch faces don’t have many complication slots. It’s essentially the Siri watch face available all of the time with a simple gesture. In fact, I’m surprised the Siri face is still available as it seems unnecessary now. The downside is it requires two hands to operate, and so it’s not as convenient as a standard complication would be.</p>
<p>At long last we have some decent new watch faces. For the past few years the new offerings have been hit and miss. It’s as if Apple sends all its junior designers on day one to the watch face division. Well those junior designers have finally graduated. The new Solar Analogue and Palette faces are beautiful, and sit well along alongside some of the original classics such as Solar and Astronomy.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cycle-computer.jpeg?w=1024" alt="an iPhone showing running metrics during a cycle workout. "></p>
<p>Another useful new feature is that when recording a cycling workout, your phone can be used to display metrics from the workout. File this under “totally obvious” because in hindsight, it is. In hindsight, of course. This is Apple at its best. Trying to look at a watch when cycling isn’t easy, and can often be downright unsafe! Now, thanks to the seamless integration between watchOS and iOS, an Apple Watch Series 4 purchased in 2018 can now be a full on cycle computer at no extra cost.</p>
<p>But I said it wasn’t all good. The biggest problem has been battery life. With watchOS 9 on my Series 8, I would typically end the day at 50% on those days when I did short workout (30mins), but with watchOS 10 it’s been down to 20%. “That’s OK” I hear you say “As long as you get through the day, that’s all that matters right?”. Wrong. It’s not acceptable for an update to regress the original capabilities of the hardware. If it was possible to get two full days from the watch, then it should be with the new update (<a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2022/10/13/how-a-battery-replacement-left-my-apple-watch-obsolete/">battery aging</a> and expected reduction in capacity notwithstanding). When I cycled around the Isle Of Wight earlier this year, I took for granted the watch could deal with a day of cycling. I often run for multiple hours at a time. I want to know the watch can cope with what I paid for it to do in the first place. With watchOS 10, I’m not so confident any more. I’m sure it’s a bug, and it will be fixed in due time, but the fact Apple didn’t spot and fix it before the release is extremely disappointing. I’ve been able to mitigate the issue somewhat by removing features such as the Weather complication and disabling background refresh for all apps. Still, I wonder if the QA department have been focusing too much on Vision Pro lately instead of the watch!</p>
<p>Playing media now seems unnecessarily complicated. Before it was clear whether you were playing a song or podcast on the watch or from your phone. Now when I navigate to the “Dowloaded” section and choose a podcast, it plays on my phone! I hope it’s a bug and will be fixed. I’m not sure in what world Apple thought someone would want to play audio from their phone via the watch by default. The only way to stop it doing this was to walk out of bluetooth range of my phone and then try to play the podcast again. A common scenario for me is selecting a podcast before a run. Now a task that took a couple of taps is going to take a lot of fiddling with Bluetooth settings. This is another example of poor quality and lack of testing. (If it is indeed a bug, if not then it is an astonishingly poor reading on how customers actually use their devices)</p>
<p>If Apple could fix the rough parts, I would recommend upgrading to watchOS 10. Right now, I wish I’d held off. I suspect after a couple of months have passed, Apple will iron out the rough bits and fix the bugs. So if you’ve not yet upgraded, I’d recommend waiting. If you have an Apple Watch Ultra but rarely use it for ultra marathons, then you might be OK with the reduced battery life. This time last year, watchOS was still the newest of Apple’s computing platforms. Now though there’s a new kid on the block: visionOS. It will be interesting to see how much attention the Apple Watch gets going forward. I’m not particularly enthused about the prospect of wearing an M1 Mac on my face, and at the current price, I won’t be trying Vision Pro for many years. The Apple Watch is still the computer that is with you all of the time and the only computer that directly senses your body. For me at least, it’s still the most exciting of Apple’s platforms.</p>

      <title>Cutting Though the AI Hype</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/05/21/cutting-though-the-ai-hype/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2023 08:24:18 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/05/21/cutting-though-the-ai-hype/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ai-hype.png?w=819" alt="An imaginary prog-rock album cover whose theme is AI"></p>
<p>There is so much hyperbole about Large Language Models (LLMs) in the media right now that I'm finding it can be overwhelming, and I am someone who works in the field of AI! From claims that <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/08/05/transparency-in-ai/">AI</a> will put people out of jobs to claims that it will takeover and enslave the human race, it's difficult to know where to start. Some say AI should be regulated now, others are happy to let the &quot;free market&quot;<a href="#notes">1</a> take its course. It's not easy to navigate, especially when many of the people with strong opinions have their own agendas. This post is really an attempt to briefly answer many of the questions I've asked myself over the past few weeks.</p>
<h2>What’s Changed and Why Now?</h2>
<p>What's changed is that recent years the neural networks that power many of the previous generation speech to text and language classification models have gotten a lot better. Not because they evolved by themselves, but because engineers and mathematicians made them better. In the case of text generation, this means GPT-3.5 and 4 are uncannily good at predicting the next set of words for a given prompt. Text to image models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are now able to predict a set of pixels that can resemble a photo-realistic image from a text prompt. In the case of Open AI and ChatGPT, there has been some genuinely mind-blowing innovation. I'm more sceptical of Microsoft, who after decades of being seen as a laggard behind Google and Apple in every industry they enter, seem a little <em>too keen</em> to plug Open AI into all of their products. Still, there is a big PR push from both companies, and Microsoft is a big investor in Open AI. What's new therefore is a breakthrough in the mathematical models which link training samples to prediction. Given the amount of money invested, it's now time to monetise, secure more investment and/or research funding.</p>
<h2>Will It Turn Against Humans and Take Over the World?</h2>
<p>A common refrain among many skeptics of AI is to make the analogy between humans and other animals on Earth. We have used our intelligence to dominate all other species and decimate the planet. Wouldn't a more intelligent being do the same to humans? It's a convincing argument but I'm not sure that the likes of Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT or their successors should worry us. In fact, I think the way in which we see these statistical models today will be akin to how some people in the 1950s saw the &quot;electronic brains&quot; that we now call computers. Mysterious and magical. Frightening. There are two reasons I am not worried. Firstly, I cannot see how the ability to predict the next word in a sentence or the pixels that make a convincing image equate to intelligence in the human sense, or anything beyond human intelligence. Even if we assume that the breakthroughs in language prediction will also be possible in other areas of life (politics, art, engineering) it's still simply providing predictions from a given input. What I can see, and think we've already seen to a certain extent already is how AI might disrupt our society. The way in which the <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2023/02/04/sorting-by-date-is-also-an-algorithm/">algorithms</a> that run social media have damaged our democracy by convincing vast swathes of the population on both the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/17/social-warming-by-charles-arthur-review-a-coolly-prosecutorial-look-at-social-media">left and the right to believe in nonsense science and conspiracy theories</a> is an obvious example of this. But there is no drive, agency or consciousness behind the AI. The second reason is history and our even current political climate tells us that intelligence is not something we should necessarily fear. Take a few examples of individuals who've caused damage to humankind in in the past. Trump, Putin, Hitler, Pinochet. I could go on. None of them are known for their raw intelligence. Charisma and ruthlessness perhaps. They manage to co-opt other intelligent people on to work their behalf. The most intelligent human beings from Einstein, Galileo and Lovelace to Lennon and McCartney are not the ones we need to worry about. I'm far more concerned about humans who have average intelligence and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_complex">Napoleon complex</a>, and have access to nuclear weapons than I am super intelligent AI.</p>
<h2>Will We All Be Out of Jobs?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I am not as optimistic on this one. I can easily see jobs like copywriting and graphic design being disrupted at the junior level. We've already seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/15/23724102/sarah-j-maas-ai-generated-book-cover-bloomsbury-house-of-earth-and-blood">an NYT Bestseller using AI generating artwork on its cover</a>. We're all told not to judge a book by its cover, but let's face it, we all do. In this case the AI generated image was listed in a stock image library alongside other human generated images, so I doubt the choice was conscious. It was also heavily modified by a human. You have to ask if the author cared so little about the cover of their book that they were happy for a stock image to be used, rather than commission an artist themselves, is there really any loss? They didn't want to pay much for the images in the first place. But somewhere, someone would have been paid something to make that image, and it hasn't happened this time. That junior designer would need to work on small jobs like this in order to get the experience and skills to go on to move up in their profession. How will they do that now? The problem I see is that with AI taking the low-end, basic work away from these professions, how does a human work their way up? On the other hand, the pocket calculator allowed mathematicians, accountants and engineers to focus on bigger problems and have the gruntwork done for them. Anyone gifted at maths can still find a well paid job, despite the fact we've had powerful calculators in our pockets for 50 years. Perhaps the same will be true of writing and graphic artistry. The bottom line is, these large models can only generate was is akin to a statistical average of what is already on the Internet. If it was perceived wisdom that the word was flat, GPT-4 would reliably tell us that the world was flat. GPT-4 has no mechanism to generate anything else and nor will its successors.</p>
<p>What about other jobs? Programming is often cited as being at risk from GPT, because it can generate code. Yet, I have yet to have it generate anything I couldn't have found by searching on Google and finding the first result on StackOverflow. When I asked it to write an application to covert files from one format to another, it told me it didn't know enough about their implementation, despite them being both public documented on the Internet. Impressive that it &quot;knew&quot; what it didn't &quot;know&quot; (I wish more developers were like that!). The jury is out, but I am not as worried about software developers all loosing their jobs because I know just how difficult software development can be, even for humans with 30+ years of experience. Implementing a variation on a well known algorithm in the abstract is one thing, but integrating it into existing business domains, data structures, user interfaces and architectures is something else entirely.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>I find it hard to get excited about the likes of GPT and Midjourney because I find them emblematic of a tech industry that has lost its way. If someone were to have suggested 20 years ago that we should build a mathematical model that can crawled web pages as an input, and then autocomplete text and images as an output, and that it could likely spread misinformation and put journalism and other important professions at risk, we would have collectively responded with a resounding &quot;Nope.&quot; While I am intrigued that we may have stumbled across a deeper mathematical theory of language, if only by chance, I am not <em>yet</em> excited by the potential utility of such models. Beyond that, I am disappointed that in a world where many people still struggle feed themselves, that is heading for a climate disaster, and where many populist leaders are coming to power, technology - something that was always a cause for optimism when I was growing up in the 90s/2000s - looks likely to make it worse, not better.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>

<li>The free market of course, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/187172/economics-the-users-guide-by-chang-ha-joon/9780718197032">doesn't exist</a>, and is generally a euphemism for 'what <em><strong>I</strong></em> want the rules to be in order to suit <em><strong>me</strong></em>'.</li>

      <title>In Praise of Apple Music (Yes, the Mac App)</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/04/16/in-praise-of-apple-music-yes-the-mac-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 18:11:03 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2023/04/16/in-praise-of-apple-music-yes-the-mac-app/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple Music has a poor reputation these days. I’m not talking about the music streaming service here, nor the iOS apps that share the same name. I’m talking about the 22 year old application formally known as iTunes. You see it’s the same application really, only with a new name and a fresh coat of paint. Squint a bit, or rather go to the Songs view and turn on Column Browser, and you will see it for what it really is. iTunes with slightly different icon and all of the video and podcast bloat removed.</p>
<p>Having been around since <a href="https://youtu.be/_5-BIPybAOI?t=3193">January 2001</a>, in many places it really shows. When compared to more modern applications that come bundled with macOS, such as the nine-year old Photos app, and unlike Apple Music for iOS Apple Music for Mac retains many of it’s power user features and can be used to manage a local music library effectively, if that’s something you still want to do.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/itunes1.png" alt=""><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ituneslatest.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Apple Music retains most of the features from the heyday of iTunes</p>
<p>Yes, it does have many annoying bugs and could certainly do with some investment in the QA department. But thankfully it still has many ‘power user’ features that I admire, and I’m grateful for this. Apple Music is able to still, believe it on not, rip CDs to MP3 or AAC and will still fetch CD metadata from the venerable Gracenote CDDB service. This may sound arcane, but <a href="https://immersiveaudioalbum.com/the-surround-sound-series-xtc-5-1-surround-sound/">some music is only available on CD</a>. (As a more general point, if you’re limiting your music discovery to what’s available on streaming services, you should definitely expand your horizons. Even the old iTunes Store has a much wider range, and streaming - especially Spotify, <a href="https://jwillgoose.tumblr.com/post/675168562108858368/streaming-payment-rates-there-has-been-a-lot-of">is notoriously bad for artists</a>.) Once ‘ripped’, the songs are uploaded into <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204146">iTunes Match</a> and are available on all of my devices, including my <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2022/01/16/has-time-been-kind-to-the-apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a>. Apple Music also allows me manually select which albums I want to keep locally, unlike the Photos app. I can also see the status of both uploads and downloads, again unlike Photos. Best of all, I can manually remove local copy of songs stored in the cloud in order to free up space on my Mac. Yet again, such a basic function is not provided by Photos. In addition, I can easily backup my music collection using the Finder, and the data will travel across different filesystems (no special, Mac-only bundle files). Best of all, Apple Music is able to mostly, seamlessly meld my offline library, tracks synchronised via iTunes Match, and songs added from Apple's music subscription service into one seamless library. It even allows me to create a &quot;Smart Playlist&quot; which can catalog songs based on whether they are rented through Apple Music, or fully owned, as well as countless other criteria such as Genre, Artist, Play Count (which incidentally, includes plays from all of my other devices), File Size, File Type, Date Added, Last Played, Composer, Year Released, and even how many times I've skipped a song. Yes, I could create a playlist of my most skipped songs. How's that for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Island_Discs">desert island disc</a>?</p>
<p>So while it's not perfect, I'm glad Apple haven't released some half-arsed rewrite of Apple Music focused on flogging their subscription. iTunes lives on for now, if not in name, then in spirit.</p>

      <title>Sorting by Date Is Also an Algorithm</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/evil-algorithm.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>It's a common refrain in tech circles when discussing Twitter to talk about &quot;The Algorithm&quot;. Take this Lifewire article: <em>&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190613224737/https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-twitter-timeline-algorithm-4174499">How to Turn off the Twitter Timeline Algorithm</a>&quot;</em>, or this one by TechCrunch: <em>&quot;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/twitter-makes-algorithmic-timeline-default-on-ios/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADCeaYUdBR1NNtjFLiP1nDMAgJItWZoj9bndqsKR3oXUleBopWE6Otoiap6zWxOEpHlPsT8fLSpym8gNJU7xqwacnEmE8WOTeVMukbNMjJxJ4ETjCKZ1pUEZ-KZtJ-lQbH2ZIgNdjmDeREqLsrdepwIqtp8vBB1dOKPDy2XQePCN">Twitter makes algorithmic timeline default on iOS</a>&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>In the beginning the Twitter timeline was a simple list of posts by people you follow sorted by date descending. In 2013 Twitter introduced a new timeline that wasn't so transparent. It was seemingly designed to optimise for engagement. All of a sudden, people were seeing posts from people they didn't follow, or that were posted days ago and for some reason had been boosted by the algorithm.</p>
<p>The point is, both the classic timeline and the &quot;algorithmic&quot; timeline are both in fact <em>algorithmic</em>. In fact, the first algorithm taught in computer science is often the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjdkw6f/revision/4">Bubble Sort</a> algorithm. It's still an algorithm! In the case of Twitter, or its upcoming rival Mastodon, sorting by date may be a preferable, but there are possibly downsides too. Prioritising something because it happens to have been posted recently is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias">Recency bias</a> after all. The key seems to be <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/08/05/transparency-in-ai/">transparency</a>.</p>
<p>So enjoy your favourite algorithm, and remember, they're not all bad.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/laptop_sleep.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>My M1 Mac mini has been sleeping dreadfully recently. Perhaps it's the thought of one day having <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/12/27/ventura-issues/">macOS Ventura</a> installed on it, or the knowledge that its younger <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/01/apple-introduces-new-mac-mini-with-m2-and-m2-pro-more-powerful-capable-and-versatile-than-ever/">M2 brethren</a> beats it in both <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/mac-mini-m2-pro-first-benchmark-scores-are-in-this-is-big">performance</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/felix_schwarz/status/1616365408356818945">power efficiency.</a> Or perhaps, it was something else altogether.</p>
<p>I could tell it wasn't sleeping due to the fact the attached USB storage would endlessly spin up and back down during the day; the Mac min sits under my desk while I work all day on my laptop. One time while it was supposedly asleep and idle, I went to plug a device into it, and could feel the fan blowing out hot air from the back. It wasn't sleeping at all.</p>
<p>Thanks to an app called <a href="https://ohanaware.com/sleepaid/">Sleep Aid</a>, I was able to verify that my Mac was indeed struggling to get to sleep. Even when I put it to sleep manually, it would quickly wake up and not go back to sleep again. Sleep Aid helpfully lists the processes that were active during time awake. In my case, the most active process was something called &quot;<strong>com.apple.FileProvider.cache-delete.push</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, I did what any self proclaimed nerd would do; I Googled it. To my surprise, there were barely any hits. Some posts relating to Android, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/715229">one</a> on the Apple Developer forum about a bug with the File Provider API, but it didn't seem related. I was stumped. Sam Rowlands, the developer behind Sleep Aid reached out to me on Twitter and offered to check that Sleep Aid itself wasn't misreporting what I was seeing. It was not.</p>
<p>Eventually I stumbled across a WWDC video on the File Provider API, and decided to watch it. It dawned on me that this is the API Apple makes for services such as Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive to use. For years, Dropbox and OneDrive have been using various unofficial hacks in order to integrate with the Finder. In 2019, Apple released the File Provider API and <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/installs/macos-faqs">gradually</a> the third party cloud sync providers have been moving to it ever since.</p>
<p>Apart from Apple's own iCloud Drive, I only had Microsoft OneDrive installed. <strong>I promptly deleted the OneDrive app and since then, my Mac has not had any bouts of insomnia due to com.apple.FileProvider.cache-delete.push</strong>. Problem solved.</p>
<p>My guess is that because I had OneDrive set <strong>not</strong> to run on system startup, and I had the OneDrive sync directory on an external hard drive, somehow the push notifications that Apple sends to indicate a file has changed were getting stuck. Perhaps OneDrive is supposed to say &quot;I've got the file, you can go back to sleep&quot; but wasn't able to do so.</p>
<p>My Mac still spends a lot of the time it is supposed to be sleeping awake, but this seems to be common in M1 Macs. Thankfully now it does go to sleep for around 40% of the time instead of 0%, helping avoid needlessly wasting energy.</p>
<p>So if you've got a Mac that won't sleep, I recommend grabbing a copy of Sleep Aid to help find the culprit.</p>

      <title>Amazon’s Echo Into the Void</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/12/11/amazons-echo-into-the-void/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 12:35:36 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/12/11/amazons-echo-into-the-void/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-job-layoffs-rise-and-fall-2022-11?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of Worldwide Digital's losses were tied to Amazon's Alexa and other devices, a person familiar with the division told Insider. The loss was by far the largest among all of Amazon's business units and slightly double the losses from its still nascent physical stores and grocery business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recall back in the summer of 2017 meeting with some senior marketing executives who worked for a multinational fashion and beauty company. We were there to talk about AI. Voice was central to the discussion. In a few years, it seemed inevitable to most people in the room that voice would be an important “touch point” for consumers wanting to interact with their brands. I felt slightly more cautious, though was easy to get wrapped up in the hype. I always imagine a simple task of ordering a meal in a restaurant. It’s far easier to peruse a menu with your eyes, than to have the waiter read you a list of what they have available to order while you try and remember and make a decision in a reasonable amount of time. In general I subscribe to the view that AI is an accelerator for human-like skills and interactions. It can speed up and automate tasks that humans do, but if those tasks don’t already make for a great experience, then AI by itself won’t make it better, unless speed and accuracy are the cause of the poor experience.</p>
<p>Alexa suffers from this “restaurant problem”. While modern Natural Language Understanding capabilities are very good, they haven’t progressed at the rate it seemed they would back in 2017. This makes Alexa great for simple commands like setting timers and playing music, but useless for anything for more substantial. A common misconception with systems such as Alexa and Apple’s Siri is that they generate the answers using AI. They don’t. Generative AI systems do except (See GPT3 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a>), but they cannot be trusted to provide accurate answers and because they are trained based on crawling the internet, they are unable to generate answers that require knowledge or recent or future events. ChatGPT won’t be able to tell you the weather tomorrow, and it won’t be able to tell you what time your local supermarket opens. Instead, systems like Alexa and Apple Siri use a form of text classification. After the sound waves from your voice are converted into symbols (letters and numbers) and those symbols are then converted into words, they take this sentence you uttered and classify it into one or more intents. The intent that scores the highest probability from the machine learning model is the one Alexa will presume was your actual intent. That’s why when I recently asked Alexa “<em>At what temperature should I hang washing outside?</em>” it thought I was was asking for a weather forecast. Someone at amazon has to have created that intent and fed the ML model with example utterances for it to be able to detect it. These systems cannot understand intents they haven’t been trained on. Once the assistant knows your intent, the next task is to extract any parameters from your utterance. Examples would be the date and location in the phrase “_Will it rain in Newport next wee_k?”. Once your voice assistant knows your intent and any parameters, it will then perform some kind of logic based on that intent. This is where the AI and machine learning typically stops. If the intent was asking the weather, then the next step would be to query a weather API. If it was to send a message to someone, then it would be to to start whichever process it used to send messages on your device. Of course the weather API itself may use AI or machine learning to predict the weather, but that is totally separate and no different to a weather presenter telling you the same forecast on the TV. This approach is extraordinarily useful for many things: most chatbots and voice assistants work like this. For people who can’t see, or find it difficult to use a touchscreen or mouse, they provide invaluable ways to interact with computing devices.</p>
<p>I use Siri all the time to set reminders, timers and to control my lights. What Alexa and Siri are not so good at is deep and meaningful conversation. This is where it seems Amazon’s hope that Alexa might one day be a shopping destination falls short. When you have a device that is centred around a conversational user experience, it will hit a wall due to current technical limitations and the fact that for many people, speaking is less efficient that using a smartphone when they need to both receive and provide information to complete the task. The fact that Amazon seemingly has no way to monetise Alexa means the experience has been gradually getting worse. Now when I ask it the weather, it responds with the forecast - great - but then immediately starts telling me I can order groceries from it as well. Ads like this are infuriating and a sign of desperation from Amazon.</p>
<p>So were we foolish to think the future of human computer interaction will be voice? No. I think in the long term, when devices are advanced enough to provide human level, meaningful conversation then there is no doubt in my mind that voice will be the one of primary user interfaces we use for <em>some</em> tasks at least. When I ask ask Alexa to order the precise groceries I want and have the confidence to know it will work, and that the device will be capability to ask me for confirm anything its unsure about then maybe I can see it working. But I still can’t help thinking that humans like to see as well as hear things, especially when it comes to making choices. Voice is great for issuing commands and receiving quick updates, but your voice assistant starts talking for more than about 20 seconds, then it’s usually quicker to glance down at a screen and see a text or graphical representation.</p>
<p>I think the future is bright for voice assistants like Siri because they complement alternative user interfaces and are part of a deep ecosystem, and so can integrate with health, home automation, contacts and other information users have provided. Voice based AI is also making large strides in call centres. Unless Amazon changes tact, the Amazon Echo however with its limited ecosystem will remain glorified clock radios for a while longer.</p>

      <title>How a Battery Replacement Left My Apple Watch Obsolete</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_0407.jpg?w=300" alt=""></p>
<p>£91 a year for a watch?</p>
<p>I’ve been using an Apple Watch for over 7 years now, and throughout this time I’ve owned the original Series 0, the Series 2, and Series 4. Recently I decided it was time to upgrade to the latest and greatest Series 8. Each time I’ve upgraded I’ve given the previous model to a family member and so my girlfriend has been wearing my old Series 2 for the past 4 years. Having been originally purchased in 2016, 6 years of daily use was most definitely taking its toll on the Series 2’s battery. My partner likes to cycle and workout, which hammers the battery even more than typical use. She was therefore keen to take on my old Series 4 which still has decent battery life. That left us with her otherwise fully functional 6 year old Apple Watch Series 2, that apart from the knackered battery, still worked absolutely fine and even paired with the latest version of iOS, version 16. I really wanted to give this to someone else in our family, and so decided to pay Apple £85 for a battery replacement.</p>
<p>Before booking the appointment with the Apple Store, I unpaired the watch from my girlfriend’s phone and paired it with my iPhone 12 mini running watchOS 16. This was so the watch would show up in my account under the Apple support web page. With my appointment at the Apple Store booked, I walked into the Apple store with both my Series 8 and the Series 2 paired to my phone to get the battery replaced. It was lucky I did pair the Series 2 to my phone, as the guy at the Genius Bar needed to run some diagnostics on the watch the verify that the battery was indeed knackered, and I guess to rule out any other faults or damage that they might get blamed for if the device were to come back faulty. With the diagnostic check passed, and my battery confirmed to be a dud, he sent it off for a replacement. Just over a week later, I received an email telling me my device was ready to be collected.</p>
<p>In actual fact, my device had been <em>replaced.</em> The box contained a factory fresh (or possibly refurbished) Apple Watch Series 2. Fair enough I thought. I can imagine how replacing the battery in such a tiny device that also has to remain waterproof might not be worth the hassle for Apple. I paid my £85 and drove home. Before handing the shiny new but also old watch to the next relative, I wanted to try and pair it with my phone again just to check everything was working as expected. This is where it all started to go down hill. I would instigate the pairing process, but get to the point where the Watch would insist on being updated, only to tell me it could not connect to the update server and to check my internet connection. I suspected this to be a case of lazy error handling on the part of the Apple developer who wrote this code, as my internet connection was fully functioning. Still, I tried on 4G just to make sure, and to my complete lack of surprise, it made no difference.</p>
<p>After some time Googling the error message, I figured out what the issue was. The replacement watch came loaded with an old version of watchOS which is not compatible with iOS 15 or iOS 16. What I needed to do was find an old iPhone running an older OS (my guess: iOS 14), upgrade the Watch to watchOS 6 (the last version supported on the S2) and then it would pair successfully with my iOS 16 device, as it had done only a week earlier. I tried on an iOS 15 device, just in case, but it made no difference. I didn’t have any older phones, at least none that were so old that they weren’t applicable for iOS 15, and nor did anybody I know. No worries I thought: I’ll go back to the Apple Store. Surely they have some kind of Mac app that can simulate any iPhone and load any watchOS version on the a device as deemed appropriate by a qualified expert?</p>
<p>My hopes were dashed when the geniuses in the Apple Store were equally as confused as I had been at first. They didn’t have any older iPhones and so the only hope would be to send the Watch back to the repair depot. They did have sympathy for the fact I’d paid for a new battery and now the device couldn’t be used, and so suggested I upgrade the S2 to the brand new Apple Watch SE, offering me a generous 50% discount off the price of a new one. I hadn’t planned on treating this other family member <em>that much</em> – but even after factoring in the £85 spent on a new battery, it seemed like such a good deal. I took them up on the offer, but the gentleman who served me said I could always pop back in on a weekday with the Series 2 and they’d still be able to send it back off to be upgraded, so it wouldn’t go to waste. I walked away with a new SE, and an obsolete S2 and got on with my life, and our family member was extremely chuffed with the early Christmas present.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, after seeing this stainless steel Apple Watch that originally cost £549 back in 2016 staring at me from the shelf every day I though maybe I should get Apple to fix it. It was still within its 90 day repair warranty, and the guy at the Apple Store had suggested It could be done. I have plenty of relatives with iPhones who would love a free Apple Watch. At £549, lasting almost exactly 6 years, it cost £91/year to own. That’s actually quite a lot for a watch. I can’t imagine being satisfied with any other Watch or piece of jewellery that cost that much only lasting 6 years. So I dropped it back into the Apple Store, and a week later it was replaced yet again. I went to collect it, and this time tried to run the pairing process in store. This time, the pairing process failed with exactly the same error message as before. The problem hadn’t been resolved, despite the service notes explicitly stating “customer wants to pair this with his iOS 16 device”. I didn’t push the issue with the staff – after all, they did look after me by offering the discounted SE. This was their “solution” to the problem in fact.</p>
<p>This brand new Series 2 was destined to sit on a shelf for ever more. What a waste.</p>
<p>The point of this post is not to complain about Apple or the staff in the Apple Store. The store staff did a good job turning around a bad situation. The point is to raise awareness about how utterly disposable Apple Watches are. I can understand that there must be a limit to how long companies like Apple provide updates to devices for, but a phone without updates will still work for a few years. The Apple Watch however won’t even pair to a modern phone, or even the the original phone I had when I bought the Series 2 (an iPhone SE, which if kept up to date would be on iOS 15).</p>
<p>So if you’re thinking of buying one of the more expensive, premium watches with premium materials, maybe think again.</p>

      <title>Apple Battery Replacement Costs Compared</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/09/15/apple-battery-replacement-costs-compared/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 20:15:21 GMT</pubDate>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/chart-apple-costs-battery-4.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Every year we marvel at the latest product releases from tech companies, with Apple often leading the way. What is often not said however is that that shiny new device with even more battery life than the previous model will quite likely be a shadow of its former self in little over 2 - 3 years. This is not a conspiracy, and there is nothing evil going on. Batteries, like brake pads on car, are consumable devices that we should expect to have to replace.</p>
<p>Unlike brakes on a car, the cost of replacing a battery can be quite the expense relative to the original price of the device. In many cases, the price of the original (or equivalent) device may have gone down by the time the battery needs replacing further reducing the gap. Why is this bad? The closer the gap between replacing a battery and the cost of a new device makes it more likely for someone to say, “My battery sucks, I’ll just buy a new one”. This is great if you’re in the market for selling new devices, but it’s not so great for the environment.</p>
<p>The chart above shows the price of a new device compared to the cost of replacing the battery, as quoted by Apple on their UK web site on the 15th of September 2022. Where there are upgrade options available (such as storage or RAM), I took the price of the base model. For AirPods, Apple quotes a price per AirPod. I was generous and only multiplied this by 2, my intuition being that customers are less likely to replace the battery in their AirPods case but will need to replace the batteries in the buds themselves.</p>
<p>As you can see, the percentage ranges from 10% for a MacBook Air M2 to a whopping 61% for the AirPods 3rd generation. For some reason it’s cheaper to replace the battery in a set of AirPods Pro than it is with the cheaper AirPods. One might argue that this is simply the price we pay for having cheaper products in the first place. Obviously, the relative cost of a battery for a £2,000 maxed out MacBook Pro will be a lot less than for a £259 Apple Watch. The problem is that the higher the cost of a replacement battery relative to simply replacing the product, the more likely consumers opt for the latter. Don’t get me wrong, there are many other reasons consumers upgrade their devices, but poor battery life surely contributes greatly to that feeling that the device is old and needs replacing.</p>
<p>Perhaps Apple could do more to nudge consumers into making fewer unnecessary purchases by reducing the cost of replacement batteries?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>After 21 years, the original macOS System Preferences is being retired.

I decided to go all the way back to 2001 and look at the original System Preferences (or “System Prefs” as it was called in the Menu Bar) in Mac OS X 10.0 “Cheeta” to see which of the original 21 preference panes made through all 21 years, and how they ended up in their final incarnation under macOS 12 “Monterey”.</p>

<h2>In sum</h2>
<p>So, after 21 years it’s fair to say that while System Preferences has evolved and become more complex, a lot has also stayed the same. Teleport someone from 2001 to 2022 and while you might need to explain the concepts of the cloud storage, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Touch ID, they would probably do just fine working out the basics of macOS. (With the major exception of those who require the use of accessibility options, which wouldn't be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2001/10/macosx-10-1/">introduced until 10.1 &quot;Puma&quot;</a>.) Since 2001, many more preference panes have been added. On a clean macOS Monterey installation, I counted 30 preferences panes. This increases to 32 if Family Sharing and iCloud are signed into. That’s an increase of about half a preference pane every year. I can therefore see why Apple might want to move to a more scalable system. That said, part of me will miss the familiarity of using System Preferences, <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/03/27/20-years-of-macos/">the same application I have used since 2001</a> at the dawn of the OS X era.</p>

      <title>iOS 16 Put Notifications on Notice</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/06/08/ios-16-put-notifications-on-notice/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 19:47:56 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/06/08/ios-16-put-notifications-on-notice/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/945ee7c2-fc29-4c9b-9417-16d704e952c2-removebg-preview.png?w=159" alt=""></p>
<p>Recently announced iOS 16 will feature a new look Lock Screen. One of the striking features is how notifications are now far less prominent than they have been ever since their arrival in iPhone OS 3.0 back in 2009.</p>
<p>The change is a signal that many users want to control what they see and when, rather than have application developers decide for them. In 2009 it was quiet novel to know instantly when someone liked your Facebook post. After 13 years the novelty has worn off. In fact, many notifications are just superfluous noise that don’t enrich our lives at all.</p>
<p>While there will always be a need for some kinds of notification, my sense is that there will be a shift towards being “off by default” in future iOS releases - much in the same way the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar">Windows system tray</a> ended up being filled with every possible kind of icon and Microsoft ended up just hiding them all by default.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ipad-computer.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>A keyboard! A mouse! But still so many unfulfilled dreams…</p>
<p>As is often the case, Matt Birchler has written something that I agree wholeheartedly with in his post <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/just-buy-a-mac-god/">Just Buy a Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if Apple goes <em>all the way</em> and lets us resize windows and drag them anywhere we want on screen, I don't think this suddenly turns the iPad into a Mac. After all, macOS, Windows, and Linux all have resizable windows that work 95% the same, but no one is out there saying that these are all basically the same operating system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(As an aside, I'd love to know how the word 'god' made it into the URL slug - now I really want to know what the original title was!)</em></p>
<p>What he hits on here is the crux of why the iPad has been a disappointment to me. The first point is that rather than advance tablet computing, Apple seems to have given up and instead opted to imitate the established laptop paradigm. They're going backwards instead of forwards. If we leave that to one side and accept that the tablet has reached its limits and in order to evolve it must act more like a traditional PC laptop, then the iPad still has the problem that its software is just too limited. The first step to remedy this would be to allow software from sources other than the App Store. There is a vast swathe of open source software and developer tools are are just waiting to be ported to the iPad, but current App Store policies forbid it.</p>

      <title>A Podcast Archive Utility</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/06/04/a-podcast-archive-utility/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2022 15:54:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/06/04/a-podcast-archive-utility/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been an avid podcast listener since it first emerged in the mid-2000s, in the past few years everyone who is anyone it seems now has a podcast. What was once the domain of nerdy introverts is now decidedly mainstream.</p>
<p>The beauty of podcasts is that like the web, they use (mostly) open standards. HTTP, RSS, XML and MP3. Like the web, they also disappear sometimes. In the case of the web, clicking links on pages written 10 years ago will inevitability result in frequent dead links, where a site’s owner has decided to move on. Go back another 10 years the the ratio of working links to 404 errors increases even more. Thankfully Archive.org can be used to recover many dead links on the web.</p>
<p>Like blogging before it, which was similarity open in spirit, economic realities will one day set in for podcasts too. Already there are shows I remember whose feeds no longer exists. The episodes are gone forever.</p>
<p>That's why I've written <a href="https://github.com/wickens/PodcastArchive">Podcast Archive.</a> A simple Command-line utility written in .NET that downloads an entire podcast feed in a tidy Year &gt; Month &gt; Date folder structure. It's smart enough not to download files that have already been downloaded, so it's safe to run over and over again without wasting bandwidth. Files downloaded will have their creation date set to the original publish date, so once downloaded you can easily use tools like Spotlight to search by date.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/screenshot3.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>At the moment you'll need to compile the app using .NET 6, but I plan to add pre-compiled versions for Windows, Linux and Mac very soon.</p>

      <title>In Shock News, Regulators Regulate</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/05/21/in-shock-news-regulators-regulate/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2022 12:05:42 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/05/21/in-shock-news-regulators-regulate/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple blogger John Gruber isn’t happy about recently agreed EU legislation. In a recent post entitled “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/05/20/eu-regulators-gonna-regulate">E.U. Regulators Gonna Regulate</a>” he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is bananas. All third party developers get control over the secure enclave and the software that controls it? Would be good to give them such control over the camera, microphone, and location data, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text of the legislation <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/56086/st08722-xx22.pdf">says the following</a> (original emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A gatekeeper that is a manufacturer of a device <strong><em>can</em></strong> restrict access to some of the functionalities in that device, such as near-field-communication technology <strong><em>secure elements and processors, authentication mechanisms and</em></strong> the software used to operate <strong><em>those technologies</em></strong>, which <strong><em>can</em></strong> be required for the effective provision of <strong><em>a</em></strong> service <strong><em>provided together with, or in support of, the core platform service</em></strong> by the gatekeeper as well <strong><em>as by any potential third party undertaking providing such service.<br>
….</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If dual roles are used in a manner that prevents alternative service and hardware providers from having access under equal conditions to the same operating system, hardware or software features that are available or used by the gatekeeper in the provision of its own complementary or supporting services or hardware, this could significantly undermine innovation by such alternative providers, as well as choice for end users.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The gatekeepers should, therefore, be required to ensure, free of charge, effective interoperability with, and access for the purposes of interoperability to, the same operating system, hardware or software features that are available or used in the provision of its own complementary and supporting services and hardware. Such access can equally be required by software applications related to the relevant services provided together with or in support of the core platform service in order to effectively develop and provide functionalities interoperable with those provided by gatekeepers.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My admittedly layperson's interpretation of the legislation is that all Apple would need to do is provide API access that would allow competitors to provide equivalent services to those that Apple provide. Just as no modern operating system gives application software <strong><em>direct access</em></strong> to the CPU and memory, Apple won’t need to give anyone <strong><em>direct access</em></strong> to the Secure Enclave if they've designed it well**.** The text explitcly says <em>&quot;A gatekeeper that is a manufacturer of a device <strong>can</strong> restrict access to some of the functionalities in that device&quot;.</em> In the same way anyone can write an application that creates Instagram-like photo filters, the EU is saying that anyone should be able to create a rival to any service Apple also offers, such as a digital wallet application or App Store. But then again I am no legal scholar and could be reading this wrong.</p>
<p>Gruber then goes on to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is profoundly anti-consumer. Consumers aren’t asking for any of this shit. Actual people love their phones more than their computers — whether Macs or PCs — not despite the fact that their phones are tightly controlled consoles, but because they are tightly controlled consoles. These regulators don’t see it that way, because they’re idiots. They think they can legislate their way to a world where the iPhone (and Android, which is also console-like) remains far safer and more reliable than PCs while mandating that all the protections that have made them far safer and more reliable than PCs be removed. It’s absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have loved to see a citation when he says <em>&quot;consumers aren’t asking for any of this shit&quot;</em>, as I presume he is referring to a survey that was carried at some point. And no, the iPhone and iPad are not consoles. <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/09/what-is-a-console/">I've covered this before</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Gruber then makes a 90º turn and drives his argument straight into a brick wall, calling the EU &quot;idiots&quot;. Instead of trying to understand the EU position and offer some valuable insights and perhaps an alternative solution, he resorts to petty name-calling.</p>
<p>He then goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worth noting: “Europe” accounts for nearly 25 percent of Apple’s revenue. That includes 23 countries that aren’t in the E.U. — most notably, of course, the U.K. — but the E.U. is too big for Apple to just tell them to pound sand. I would imagine though, if this comes to fruition, E.U. citizens are going to wind up buying iPhones that operate very differently from those sold everywhere else in the world, and they will suffer for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is an overly pessimistic take on the proposals. If Apple were to constructively engage with the EU, then opening up iOS could give the ecosystem a boost and offer some much needed novelty and excitement that has been missing for at least half a decade. I can't remember the last time I installed a new app on my iPhone or iPad that excited me in some way. Between 2010 and 2013 it seemed like every week there was something new and exciting my devices could do with a new app. Now it seems that all we get is more and more refined text editors and to-do list apps. Instead, I fear that Apple will belligerently fight the EU, resulting in poor outcomes for everyone.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I agree with every word of the EU legislation, far from it. The EU has a poor track record when it comes to legislating tech companies. Just look at the Microsoft browser-ballot which was far too late to be effective, and mandatory cookie banners which haven't solved any of the concerns around privacy yet have made browsing the web far more annoying. I just feel that a more constructive discourse that goes beyond &quot;they're idiots&quot; is needed. I don't want to live in a world where my Sony TV only lets me watch movies from Sony Pictures, or a Telsa Car that only allows me drive to some future Elon Musk-owned restaurant chain, yet that's essentially how the iPhone and iPad operate today when it comes to certain vertical markets.</p>
<p>It is possible to be a fan of Apple while resisting the paternal instinct to defend everything it does. Surely a company that can make a UNIX-based wrist-computers and competition-thrashing CPUs can figure out a way to allow 3rd parties take payments, or run App Stores without compromising security?</p>

      <title>The Software Slump</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/04/27/the-software-slump/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Riccardo Mori writing in an essay <em><a href="http://morrick.me/archives/9542">Raw power alone is not enough</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without innovation in software, all we’re doing with these new powerful machines is essentially the same we were doing 20 years ago on PowerPC G4 and G5 computers, but faster and more conveniently. Granted, it is progress, especially in those fields involving CPU- and GPU-intensive tasks and greatly benefitting by having lots and lots of calculations made in the shortest possible time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree. Where is the modern software to take advantage of the extraordinary amount of power that computers, especially Macs have these days? Just look at this chart:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/m1-performance.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p><em>The MacBook Air multicore performance over time (source <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-late-2020">Geekbench</a>)</em></p>
<p>Take a brand new MacBook Air or MacBook Pro out of the box in 2022 and despite it having more than double the raw compute power compared to 5 years ago, the included software is basically the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>iMovie is designed for an age when people shared home movies imported from their camcorder. Where is the video creation software that is designed creating modern YouTube oriented productions, but without the steep learning curve of <a href="https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/support-open-letter-to-tim-cook-about-final-cut-pro.html">Final Cut Pro</a>? Something as &quot;simple&quot; as blurring out someone's face or making text move with an object on the screen is extraordinarily time consuming in iMovie.</li>
<li>There is an app for listening to podcasts, but not one for creating them. Apple makes GarageBand, FaceTime and runs the iTunes Podcast directory. It should also make a product that leverages these technologies to make it even easier to record either remote (via FaceTime) or in-person podcasts, edit them, add chapter-art and show-notes and easily distribute them to the Apple Podcast directory. Spotify will get there first otherwise.</li>
<li>Bring back iWeb! The web is full of siloed platforms and while it's never been easier to create a blog or get your thoughts out there - usually via the likes of Wordpress or other hosted platforms, these often hit limits unless you start stump up a lot of cash or invest time in learning the technical skills required. The barrier to entry for creating a custom web site is innumerably higher than it was in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEAzwruGnc">early days</a> of the web. I would love to see Mac that came with software for visually creating high quality, standards compliant web sites that can be hosted anywhere (even on the Mac itself) but don't require knowledge of HTML, CSS, databases, Node or PHP etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are doubtless plenty of other examples, let's not even start on how stagnated Windows has become over the last decade.</p>
<p>* Yes, the title of this post is a play on one of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sophtware_Slump">favourite albums</a> by Grandaddy.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sami Fathi <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/14/apple-says-meta-plan-is-hypocritical/">writing for MacRumours</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, it was revealed that Meta, more commonly known as Facebook, plans to take a steep 47.5% commission for digital asset purchases made inside the so-called &quot;metaverse.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of how in the early 2000s Apple was able to make a deal with the record labels to sell <em>all</em> of their music while taking a healthy cut of their own. Since then they have been an unstoppable force in the digital music industry. The same deal never happened with TV and films. To this day, there is still no single streaming service that lets you watch any TV show and film you can think of, like there is for music. Not wanting to be beholden to Apple, the TV and movie industry learnt from the record companies' past mistakes. I think the lack of any significant new platforms since the smartphone could be a similar reaction from software developers. Why would anyone want to build software for a world run by Facebook, where they take a 50% cut? Short of groundbreaking hardware (unlikely), what does Facebook have to offer developers other than its now dated, millennial oriented, social graph?</p>

      <title>Has Time Been Kind to the Apple Watch?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/01/16/has-time-been-kind-to-the-apple-watch/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 14:29:24 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2022/01/16/has-time-been-kind-to-the-apple-watch/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/apple-watch-low-battery-2.png?w=858" alt=""></p>
<p>What do BBC News, Instagram, Twitter, Slack, Pokémon GO, eBay and Uber have in common? They all had watchOS apps that have since been discontinued. This week Uber became the latest big name to switch off their Apple Watch app. There are still many useful apps from big and small developers in the watchOS App Store: YouTube Music, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Maps are still present (the latter making a comeback recently after being discontinued in 2017). There does however seem to be a trend towards big companies abandoning their ambitions for our wrists, the the remaining apps being far less ambitious.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Apple Watch, Apple would routinely demonstrate it being used to make phone calls, get directions, order food, open garage doors (with a live camera feed) and measure long hikes across the countryside without the need for a phone. The wrist was an existing new frontier for application developers to explore.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/apple-watch-apps.png?w=715" alt=""></p>
<p>I remember in early 2015 - before I had the chance to own an Apple Watch - seeing someone pay for a coffee in Starbucks using their watch. This was before the release of Apple Pay in the UK, and so I concluded this individual must have been using the Starbucks app to make the payment. I thought this was extremely cool, and when I eventually managed to buy my own Apple Watch I installed as many apps as I could on it. Task list managers, calendars, train timetables, news apps, takeaway food services, Reddit clients and even a game of Pong. I even used the aforementioned Uber app during a trip to San Francisco, though remember it being somewhat limited when compared to the iPhone app. This excitement culminated with me upgrading to a cellular model of Apple Watch. I had hopes for this UNIX computer on my wrist to replace my phone in many situations. I could improve my mental health too, by carrying a phone less, and therefore spend less time looking at a screen.</p>
<p>It didn’t happen of course. Despite my cellular Apple Watch Series 4 being plenty fast enough to run 3rd party apps (something that could not be said for the original model) I found most of the applications built for it were either too limited, too buggy, or didn’t exist. The lack of an official WhatsApp client and inability to initiate a conversation from the Watch for example really hampers its usefulness. It was also too easy to run the battery down over the course of a few hours by visiting a location with poor 4G signal. A few times, when simultaneously using the watch’s features by having cellular data, GPS, workout tracking, music the screen flash as a light - all at the same time - the watch simply powered itself down under the stress of it all. I've never known an iPhone to do this.</p>
<p>These days, the Apple Watch fills a less ambitious role in my life. I still use the same Series 4 model from 2018. I no longer pay for a dedicated cellular plan - it just doesn’t seem worth the £5 - £7 a month the mobile operators charge. My usage boils down to just a few tasks now. Telling the time, tracking runs, listening to podcasts, using Siri to control HomeKit lights, and of course, notifications. The only 3rd party app I have installed now is an Authenticator app, which I’m not even sure I need as I seem to be able to confirm logins from the notification and never need to launch the app itself.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch in this respect is a bit of a disappointment. I can say the same for the iPad, which once promised to usher in an era of multitouch computing but ended up moving in the direction of a convertible laptop with much of the software looking and behaving like desktop software that came before. The Apple Watch once promised us a dream of wrist-based ambient computing that would fit so seamlessly into our lives that we would barely notice it, but it would be there when we need it. It has ended up being mostly a fitness tracker and notification device.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/apple-watch-uber.png?w=570" alt=""></p>
<p>What can Apple do to turn this around? It’s difficult to say. Allowing the Apple Watch work without the need for an iPhone would probably be the biggest thing. This would mean the need for a better battery when on cellular. It might also encourage developers to build capable apps for the platform, as it would no longer be a given that the user also has a smartphone in their pocket. This might also mean Apple is more incentivised to support more capable APIs for the watch because suddenly the need is there. As it stands, the Apple Watch always has its older sibling, the iPhone standing over its shoulder as it attempts to make its mark on the world. It needs to be able to stand and compete on its own merits. Would today’s Apple do let this happen? While Apple in 2007 was happy to compete against its own iPod with release of the iPhone, today it seems less bold. The iPad is held back and after 11 years is still not as capable as a Mac despite having very similar hardware. While I would like to see an Apple Watch that truly ushers in a post-smartphone world, sadly I think if it happens it will likely come from another company rather than Apple.</p>

      <title>20 Years of the iPod</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/11/06/20-years-of-the-ipod/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 19:01:57 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/11/06/20-years-of-the-ipod/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipod-first-gen-ipod5.5.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>My original iPod (left), alongside the iPod 5.5 and the Apple Watch, in many ways its successor.</p>
<p>It’s been 10 years since I wrote about it being <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2011/11/06/10-years-of-the-ipod/">10 years since the iPod.</a> That means of course that it’s now been 20 years since Steve Jobs first graced our 1024x768 screens announcing the iPod. I won’t rehash what I wrote 10 years ago, instead I thought it would be interesting delve into what the technology scene was like 20 years ago.</p>
<p>In 2001, I was 16 years old. I had left school in May and started college on September 10th 2001. I will always remember starting college the day before the 9/11 attacks. We had started on the Monday, and our tutor gave us the Tuesday off, telling us to come back on Wednesday. Nobody quite expected the world to have changed so much in the space of little over 24 hours. The gap between leaving school and the attacks was only a few short months. I mention this only to say that no matter the topic, it’s impossible to consider the world in 2001 without remembering that day.</p>
<p>My computer in 2001 was a G3 iMac of the Snow variety. I had bought this in the summer with some money my grandparents had given me. Back then, and still now, buying a new computer was not something I did often. The difference now is that I have many devices that could be considered a computer: a phone, tablet, laptop and even my Apple Watch. At the turn of the century a computer was something you kept on or under a desk.  Macs were not particularly cool, especially within tech circles. The arrival of Mac OS X, with its UNIX underpinnings gave it some street cred amongst geeks like me. I could justify buying one promising I'd be able to learn the Unix command line, while also running user friendly GUI software such as Microsoft Word, and connecting to printers and scanners - a task that was not easy on Linux at the time.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/palm-m100.jpg?w=274" alt=""></p>
<p>I bought the iMac from John Lewis (there was no Apple Store in the UK at the time) and still vividly remember the excitement of going to collect it, and how unexpectedly <em>heavy</em> the box was (it had a full CRT screen of course).  Initially Mac OS X was far too slow to actually use, and so my dreams of using the iMac to learn the Unix had to be put on hold. Around this time, my phone would have been a Motorola T191. A basic phone that had only one thing going for: it looked cool. To really satisfy my inner geek, I had managed to save up to buy a Palm m100. In 2001, if you wanted a PDA, you wanted a Palm.  For a cool one-hundred pounds, or £170 in today’s money, I had a device that could store phone numbers, take notes and play two-play pong over infrared. It supported email, but only when synchronised over from the Mac. There was no web browser to be seen, and certainly no music. The only audio the Palm m100 was capable of was a Casio watch style “beep”. Instead, my portable music needs were taken care of thanks to a £50 Panasonic portable CD player. It was capable of playing not only audio CDs, but also MP3 CDs. These were CDs stuffed with MP3 files. This meant you could fit more than the usual 10 or so songs that would fit onto a CD. It was portable, but with caveats. It’s bulk meant unless I was wearing a hoodie or fleece with large pockets, it had nowhere to go. It was also difficult to control the music while walking. Still, for 2001 it was great.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/steve-jobs-ipod-2001.jpg?w=300" alt=""></p>
<p>Then the iPod happened. I watched the Steve Jobs keynote on my iMac after reading about it in the news.  There was something about it being Mac exclusive ,and <em>me being a Mac user</em> that made it stand out to me. I was lucky enough to get one for Christmas that year. £300 Christmas presents were certainly not a regular thing for me - I don’t know what my parents were thinking!  Initially, my friends laughed at the white earbuds, it would take years for them to be normalised by Apple’s marketing campaigns. The original iPod was extremely easy to scratch, and so I sought a case to protect it. Unlike today where they are a myriad of case options available for every device under the sun, at the time of the iPod’s first release there was no such thing. I ended up buying a case from a specialist photography shop - it was designed to hold a camera flash.  From then on, my experience of music, along with millions others was that of buying the CD, feeding it into my computer, and then synchronise it with my iPod. The CD then went back on the shelf. A new generation of music lovers was born. To this day, when I think about playing a song I start with the artist, locate the album, and press play. One time, I was browsing CDs in <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2011/01/23/i-bought-a-cd/index.html">HMV</a> and frustrated at the thought of having to wait until I got home before I could listen to my new CD, I had the killer idea - what if the HMV (a bricks and mortar music retailer for anyone who doesn't know) had some kind of machine that would let you scan the barcode of the CD and plug in your iPod so you could listen to your purchase there and then? Of course this became somewhat of a reality 6 years later when the Apple introduced iPod touch and the iTunes music store. Now of course we have steaming services and music is easier to access than ever. We can now ask Siri (other assistants are available) to play virtually any song on demand. Where next for recorded music consumption? I have no idea, but I certainly look back fondly on the days of the iPod.</p>

      <title>The Little Things: Teams vs. iMessage</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/10/26/the-little-things-teams-vs-imessage/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:10:46 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/10/26/the-little-things-teams-vs-imessage/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/teamsvsimessage2.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Both Microsoft Teams and Apple’s iMessage offer the ability to ‘react’ or ‘tap back’ on a message - for those who don’t know, this allows you to mark a message with a quick emoji response instead of sending a full message back.</p>
<p>I’m a heavy user of both apps: Teams while I’m working, and iMessage for keeping in touch with friends and family.</p>
<p>Despite Teams being targeted at business - I find the iMessage implementation so much more well through-through and appropriate.</p>
<p>While they both have a thumbs up - check 👍 - the heart in Teams feels a bit too much like a ‘romantic heart’ and unless Microsoft are condoning workplace romances - probably best avoided lest you end up in trouble with HR - I can’t see what they were thinking here. On the other hand, iMessage manages to remain neutral - a small platonic heart that doesn’t <em>throb</em> is much more appropriate for work.</p>
<p>Teams also lacks a simple thumbs down, a way to convey the word ‘no’. Unbelievably, it instead opts for crying emoji, or even worse - a red-faced anger emoji. There aren’t many times I feel like crying in response to a co-worker’s message, or get so angry I turn red - but often I could use a simple thumbs down. The biggest omission from Team however is the humble question mark. Being able to simply question what someone said - that is ask them to expand on what they meant and clarify - is something that often needs to be communicated with colleagues.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that really spending the time to think through little details like this can make all the difference in how useful the feature is. Apple clearly thought more about it in my view. On this feature at least, Teams gets a big 😢 from me.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/teams-reactions.gif?w=878" alt=""></p>
<p>Footnote: None of these animated icons are <em>technically</em> emoji - but you know what I mean.</p>

      <title>Developer Centric Design</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/10/17/developer-centric-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 09:29:54 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/10/17/developer-centric-design/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The new version of Safari for iPad is a classic case of 'developer centric design'. That is, designing a product that you as a developer would love to have, but not considering how a less technical user base might approach the app. Take the new sidebar - technically, it's a marvel: I can access tab groups (a new feature), my bookmarks, the reading list and browsing history all from one convenient location. In addition, Private browsing is now just another tab group - how cool is that? I wonder if they inherit the same Objective-C <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/objective_c_inheritance.htm">interfaces</a> under the hood? Of course they do - and that's the problem. The interface appears to have been designed around its technical implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img_0142_ipadair4_skyblue_landscape.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img_0142_ipadair4_skyblue_landscape.png?w=656" alt=""></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bookmarks_ios1.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bookmarks_ios1.jpg?w=656" alt=""></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While new the new 'do everything' sidebar in Safari might sound great on paper, it just doesn't old up in real world usage. Since the release of iOS 15, I've found myself using the iPad far less because of this. Tasks that should be highly optimised are frustratingly slow to complete. Take opening a bookmark and then closing the sidebar in order to browse using the entire width of the screen. It takes up to 6 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the sidebar</li>
<li>Optionally press <em>back</em> if the side bar was in another list (History or Reading List)</li>
<li>Select <em>Bookmarks</em></li>
<li>Navigate to the bookmark and click it</li>
<li>Navigate back up to the root of the sidebar</li>
<li>Close the sidebar</li>
</ol>
<p>Contrast this with the original version of Safari:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the <em>bookmarks</em> toolbar button</li>
<li>Navigate to the bookmark and click it</li>
</ol>
<p>That is 3, maybe 4 additional steps - for something which I imagine is a pretty common action.</p>
<p>While I'm not suggesting we all revert to a version of Safari that came out 10 years ago, I think the spirit of the original design: simplicity and usability are still worthwhile goals in 2021. Even with advanced features such as tab groups and browser extensions, there has to be a better way. A simple fix would be to add a bookmarks button back to the toolbar, and remove <em>tab groups</em> from the sidebar entirely (that functionality can also be accessed from the tab overview screen).</p>
<p>Importantly, Apple need to learn how to <em>think like their users</em> again, and not build products simply for themselves. While I can't claim to represent all Apple users, I'm certainly <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/15/safari-15-favorites-bar">not the only one</a> who finds the new design messy and confusing.</p>

      <title>Glass: Half Empty</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/09/01/glass-half-empty/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 07:56:56 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/09/01/glass-half-empty/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/glass-app-review.jpg?w=398" alt=""></p>
<p>Like every other Apple-focused technology enthusiast with spare time on their hands, I’ve been trying out <a href="https://glass.photo/updates/hello">Glass</a>, a new app for sharing photos. Its biggest selling point according to the creators, is that they are in fact <em>selling</em> it. Unlike rivals Instagram and Flickr, Glass is not for <em>“selfies, stories, quick snaps, or influencers”</em> and there is no free tier. Instead, Glass costs £4.49 per month or £25.99 for the year as an introductory offer, going up to around £48.00 per annum after the introductory period is over.</p>
<p>As someone who loves photography, but dislikes the way in which Instagram has turned into a late 90s glossy lifestyle magazine with its over-reliance on filters and airbrushing, Glass seemed like a breath of fresh air. In addition to selling this app instead of selling out their users, Glass also does away with traditional social media metrics: like counts and follower counts. While these seemed innocent and innovative in 2010, it has become apparent that such metrics though meaningless in themselves can be terrible for our mental health, and certainly do no correspond with any real sense of worth or value. The business model of selling the app instead of customer data means that in theory it doesn’t matter how long someone spends in Glass, because they are not optimising to maximise eyeballs on ads. This allows Glass to forego the algorithmic timeline that every other social media platform uses and instead offer a simple chronological timeline and feels more like Twitter circa 2009.</p>
<p>That said, upon signing opening Glass for the first time, I was surprised that there is no functionality available unless you sign up for a subscription. Not even ability to even view photos from other people without posting, which I would have expected. The first 2 weeks of the subscription are free however, and so I gave it a go.</p>
<p>First impressions were good: the app is mostly well designed. There are some odd quirks, the back button is in the bottom left of the screen, instead of the top left as it is in nearly every other iOS app, which even after 2 weeks still throws me. The portrait orientation of the iPhone doesn’t work well with photos that are taken in landscape. Glass attempts to remedy this by zooming in and allowing you to pan the image, but I would have preferred to be able to rotate my phone and browse in landscape instead.</p>
<p>Upon first launch I was invited to follow a selection of accounts. I’ve no idea whether this was a random list, or whether they have an algorithm that attempts to show you “interesting” people based on how many other people follow them or some other metric. After a day or two I’d built up list of about 15 people I was following. After that I uploaded some old photos that I was particularly proud of. It turned out this is exactly what everyone else did too. Nearly all of the photos the app displayed to me had dates on them from months and years before the app had launched. The chronological timeline seemed somewhat broken with photos from all seasons seemingly thrown in. This quirk will perhaps become less pronounced as the influx of new users cedes, but for now think of Glass as a place where people post their “best of” photos, rather than a window into what is happening in the world.</p>
<p>After a few days, boredom started to settle in. There were some nice photographs alright. Plenty in fact. But the web is not short of great photography. I found it difficult to discover anything interesting or above average. I particularly like landscape photography, but I couldn’t find a way to search for it, nor did Glass seem to know this and show me more of it. There are places I frequent and photograph a lot, and I wanted to see other people’s take on them. However there is no way to search by location either.  Instead, it’s up to me to follow the right people. It left me longing for an algorithm. Yes, an evil algorithm! The thing is, algorithms are not evil. It’s how they are used that determines whether they are good or bad. If an algorithm is used to optimise for “engagement” for the purposes of selling more advertisements, then this is bad. In the case of Glass, I’d quite like to see something pop up in my feed that is popular or of potential interest, but alas this did not happen.</p>
<p>Another thing I noticed, at least based on the list of people I see in the “follow people” tab, Glass seemed to be somewhat of a monoculture. This makes sense: everyone in the app is rich enough to own an iPhone, probably also owns an expensive dedicated camera, a laptop (probably a MacBook) capable of editing them, and has enough discretionary income to pay a monthly subscription to a social media platform. This is boring. While I’m no fan of Instagram, it does at least seem to attract people from all parts of society. Perhaps this will come with time, if Glass decide to expand beyond its initial user base of photography enthusiasts. For now, where Instagram is the economy section on a plane, Glass aspires to be the first class area with none of the undesirables. This may not be a conscious decision, but it’s a direct consequence of being iOS only and charging a monthly fee.</p>
<p>So is Glass for me? While I really wanted to like Glass, and I have genuinely found some great photographs on it, the staleness and sameness of the content leaves me wanting more for my £4.49/month. I'll be checking back in a few months, hopefully by then this glass will be brimming.</p>

      <title>Google’s Native Advertising Problem</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/07/15/googles-native-advertising-problem/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 19:50:15 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/07/15/googles-native-advertising-problem/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've noticed that Google's search results are full of a lot more spam recently. When I scroll past the page of ads that Google itself places at the top of the results page and jump straight to the so called 'organic' search results, I find more than more that these links turn out to be nothing more than thinly veiled advertisements themselves.</p>
<p>In one example, after finding out my new router supports connecting my entire network to a VPN, I searched Google for the model name and the word '<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=fritzbox+vpn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">VPN</a>&quot;. The second result was an article that was quick point out that my router doesn't support Express VPN, but I should probably just use it anyway. There was of course a big fat button linking to Express VPN. Using the excellent <a href="https://wheregoes.com/trace/20215089724/">wheregoes.com</a> I was quickly able to verify that yes, this was a referral link. This article exists for no other reason than to make money from confused users.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/expressvpn_spam.png?w=946" alt=""></p>
<p>Minutes later I searched for how to synchronise to Macs without using iCloud. The 2nd result was <a href="https://macpaw.com/how-to/sync-two-macs">this page</a> by MacPaw.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macpaw-search-spam.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>The article has runs through some rudimentary waffle about how cloud synchronisation works, and then about halfway down the pages suddenly breaks into an advert for their product &quot;CleanMyMac X&quot;. An app that is completely unrelated to file synchronisation.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macpaw-spam2.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>While I've nothing against so called &quot;inbound marketing&quot; articles, they can often have genuine value (Digital Ocean's vast array of tutorials for configuring Linux servers are some of the best on the web), it's clear that Google has a big problem on its hand in distinguishing the cruft from the genuinely useful content.</p>

      <title>How to Remove Clickbait Headlines From Apple News</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/06/19/how-to-remove-click-bait-headlines-from-apple-news/</link>

      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/06/19/how-to-remove-click-bait-headlines-from-apple-news/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple News can be a nice way to catch up on the day’s events, however it can also be a source of clickbait headlines and celebrity gossip that I couldn’t care less about. I’m sure it’s the inverse for others too, perhaps you want to read celebrity gossip but keep getting exaggerated political controversies.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is an option hidden away in the iOS Settings app called “<em>Restrict Stories in Today</em>”. Turning it on will cause News to limit articles to those from publishers you actively follow.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend following a wide variety of outlets to avoid a filter bubble, but I’ve found this option to be a great quality filter so far.</p>

      <title>Fancier MacBooks Are on the Way, but You Probably Don’t Need One</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macbook-pro-m1.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Rumours are abundant, and so it <em>must</em> be true that in the coming months Apple will release updated versions its high-end computers. But for the majority of users, even us “professionals”, the current crop of M1 Macs will probably do just fine.</p>
<p>I've been using an M1 MacBook Pro as my own personal laptop now for 3 and a half months and I have to admit, the hype is real. It's a beast. Day to day it's exceedingly fast at nearly everything I throw at it. Anything you could possibly consider “day to day” use doesn’t even warrant a mention - it’s blindingly fast. It breezed through more advanced photo editing, compiling apps using Xcode, editing video in the Photos app, and pretty much every other task I've thrown at it. Contrary to many reports however is the fan. It does get extremely loud when performing intense tasks. In my case, when transcoding video that wasn't natively supported by the M1's instruction set.</p>
<p>In comparison to my other laptop, a work-provided 15&quot; Dell XPS 9500 running Intel's 2020 i7 which has a bigger screen and costs £400 more but is far is hotter, slower and less reliable (frequently overheating while charging to a point it shuts itself off, and unable to stay in sleep mode without draining the battery completely over night) the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are no-brainers for anyone who doesn't need Windows to do their job.</p>
<p>Unless you are playing (or making) AAA games, working with video at a professional level, or training large machine learning models, the current crop of M1 Macs will likely far exceed your needs. Even Marco Arment can <a href="https://overcast.fm/+R7DWXqqm0/47:00">get by with the latest MacBook Air</a> for software development. As with any processor transition, it's not all plain sailing - I struggled to get an older version of TensorFlow working on the M1 Mac because Apple have forked the project for M1 at a later version - but these kind of teething issues will resolve themselves over time. As with anything like this, if you have specific software needs, check compatibility first.</p>
<p>So while the latest, shiniest, <em>fastest</em> laptop might seem temping, the mid-range is where the value is right now.</p>

      <title>WWDC 2021: Quick Thoughts</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/06/07/wwdc-2021-quick-thoughts/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/img_0161.jpeg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Lots and lots of goodies in Apple's 2021 keynote. Some quick thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FaceTime on the web</strong> - I guess <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/25/why-zoom-and-not-facetime/">just</a> as I was last pondering this May, someone at Apple was also wondering why <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/25/why-zoom-and-not-facetime/">Zoom took off and not FaceTime</a>. Thankfully they reached the same conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Digital ID</strong> - The ability to add ID to our digital wallets will finally end the need for a physical wallet. I wrote about this at the end of 2019 and so was pleased when the presenter almost quoted the title of my post <em><a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2019/12/31/the-card-missing-from-our-digital-wallets/">The card missing from our digital wallets</a></em>. At the moment it's US only, but at least it's a start.</li>
<li>The Mail app will now <strong>proxy images to protect privacy</strong>. Has Hey.com just been <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/297651/what-does-it-mean-when-a-company-sherlocks-an-app/">Sherlocked</a>? All along I've said this kind of functionality should be something a <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/20/hey-com-should-be-an-email-client-not-provider/">mail client offers, not the email service itself</a>.</li>
<li><strong>On-device speech to text</strong> will dramatically help Siri's performance. The current cloud-based STT is often so slow I <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/01/making-siri-timers-more-timely/">manually deduct 30 seconds</a> from the time I actually want to set a timer for. I didn't notice any mention of <em>i<a href="https://blog.rasa.com/rasa-nlu-in-depth-part-1-intent-classification/">ntent recognition</a></em>, and so I assume it is still likely cloud-based, which means an Internet connection will still be required for many Siri tasks.</li>
<li>Apple will allow developers to <strong>A/B test App Store</strong> listings. While I understand this kind of testing can be effective, I'm coming round to the view that perhaps <em>asking</em> users is more polite than bypassing their consciousness.</li>
<li>Being able to <strong>edit dictated text on the <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2015/07/08/apple-watch-review/index.html">Apple Watch</a></strong> <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2015/07/08/apple-watch-review/index.html"></a>is fantastic and solves a major problem: most ML based STT systems still struggle with unexpected, out of context words. It looks like Apple are moving watchOS towards where early iPhone models were when it comes to content creation with the ability to share photos as well.</li>
<li><strong>Built in VPN</strong> for iCloud+ users. Did I understand this right, that anyone paying for storage currently will now be an 'iCloud+' user? Surly that can't be right? Apple don't give features like this away for free!</li>
<li><strong>iPad multitasking</strong> - Looks good. We now have the Shelf, a nice reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelf_(computing)">NeXTSTEP</a> which of course had its very own shelf that would become the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock_(macOS)">Dock in macOS</a>.</li>
<li>On the presentation itself, I find myself missing the days of one or two presenters simply <strong>levelling with an audience to explain what's new</strong>. For the past for years, and even pre-pandemic, there have been dozens of presenters, high-production videos, and special effects that seem more at home in a Hollywood blockbuster than a developer talk. It makes one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world seem even less relatable.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Note</strong>. Great name, but <a href="http://home.clara.net/m-w/quicknote/index.html">where have I heard it before?</a> Hmm…</li>
<li>A <strong>menu bar</strong> on the iPad, which was pretty much the conclusion of my recent post <em><a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/04/25/the-tablet-dilemma-powerful-laptop-replacement-or-casual-consumption-device/">The Tablet</a></em> <em><a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/04/25/the-tablet-dilemma-powerful-laptop-replacement-or-casual-consumption-device/">Dilemm</a>__<a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/04/25/the-tablet-dilemma-powerful-laptop-replacement-or-casual-consumption-device/">a</a></em>.</li>

      <title>All News Is Breaking News</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/05/31/all-news-is-breaking-news/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iphone-mini-red-showing-a-bbc-news-alert.jpeg?w=300" alt=""></p>
<p>Having set up a new phone recently, I started receiving &quot;Breaking News&quot; alerts from the BBC. I must have accidentally granted permission when installing the app. I left them turned on, thinking perhaps this time I might find it useful, especially given the precarious worldwide situation right now. Within hours though, I remembered why I'd turned them off years ago - not just from the BBC - from all news apps.</p>
<p>In my mind, I had &quot;breaking news&quot; as meaning &quot;important news worthy of interrupting your day&quot;. The would obviously include kind of thing the BBC may have traditionally interrupted television programming for; the death of a monarch, war breaking out, or the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52012432">announcement of a lockdown due to a global pandemic</a>. Of course an alert on your phone isn't the same <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/apr/02/bbc.queenmother1">cancelling the nation's favourite weekly medical drama</a>, and so I expected alerts with slightly less gravity but still serious and impactful all the same.</p>
<p>This is not what &quot;breaking news&quot; means. In the news business, breaking news is news that is &quot;new news&quot;. This is why we get alerts about a press conference that is due to start on time, as scheduled. While I have no direct knowledge of the media business, it seems to me that there is a race between various news broadcasters to be the first to &quot;break&quot; news. I'm sure that by adding &quot;breaking news&quot; to a story it feeds the audience's desire to read the latest gossip, and this generates clicks, which looks good for the reporter in question. It's similar how in the early days of the pandemic when we had daily briefings, rather than insightful questions from health or science correspondents, we had political correspondents trying to outdo each other in trying to ask the most original and intricate question, hoping to trip up the politician at the podium.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt an audience of avid news junkies who enjoy receiving notifications about mundane events as they happen, I think there's a larger need for alerts about serious and important events only. Please, news broadcasters, give us the choice!</p>

      <title>The Tablet Dilemma: Powerful Laptop Replacement or Casual Consumption Device?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/04/25/the-tablet-dilemma-powerful-laptop-replacement-or-casual-consumption-device/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week Apple announced a new version of the iPad Pro, a £749 tablet that includes pretty much the same internals as the other recent Macs including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Mini. Once you up the storage to a more acceptable (but still bare minimum) 256GB and add in the optional Magic Keyboard, the cost ends up being £1,178, slightly more than a similar spec’d MacBook Air, which starts at £999.</p>
<p>The iPad and Mac having comparable specifications is nothing new. For many years it has been apparent that Apple’s top end tablets could outperform even some of the higher end laptops on single core tasks. Now, with both products using the same chip, and with Apple giving the iPad Pro the same M1 processor they’ve used in Macs, many people are starting to wonder why the iPad is still so limited by its operating system. Harry McCracken, a longtime proponent of using iPads as a primary computing device wrote “[<em>The iPad Pro just got way more pro. Now it needs pro software</em>](http://The iPad Pro just got way more pro. Now it needs pro software)”.  Over at The Verge, Monica Chin wrote “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"><em>Put macOS on the iPad, you cowards</em></a>”, a headline that seems sure to fire up camaraderie on Twitter.  Jason Snell, one of my favourite writers about all things Mac, wrote “<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/343907/ipad-pro-thunderbolt-micro-led-xdr-display-m1-apps-speed.html"><em>The iPad Pro is a killer machine but its software is killing me</em></a>”. It seems there is a consensus.</p>
<p>For a long time this has been my view too. I’ve <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2015/11/14/better-software-not-a-bigger-screen-is-what-the-ipad-needs/index.html">written</a> <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2016/04/19/the-ipad-isnt-a-pc-replacement-for-everyone-yet/index.html">many</a> <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2016/02/07/ipad-demise/index.html">times</a> <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2015/05/03/can-an-ipad-replace-a-laptop-seriously/">before</a> that what holds back the <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2011/08/06/i-did-it-i-bought-an-ipad/index.html">iPad</a> is its software not its hardware. The touch screen revolution didn't quite happen as planned. 11 years after the iPad was first introduced, most people still turn to a desktop or laptop with a mouse and keyboard when they really want to get work done. But with tablet hardware so powerful, and with the software that feels 'almost there' it's reasonable to ask why can't we do more with our expensive iPads. The solution however, is not simple. Allowing users to reboot their iPad into macOS as Chin seems to suggest would be one answer, but it would require either macOS to be redesigned to accommodate touch input, or that Apple <em>require</em> users connect a trackpad and keypad to their iPad when using it in “Mac Mode”. This doesn’t seem very elegant to me - though technically probably not difficult, and Apple is all about elegance. Adding touch to macOS would beg the question of why Mac laptops don’t have touch screens and risk destroying what makes macOS such a great operating system. (<a href="https://www.thurrott.com/forums/microsoft/windows/thread/was-windows-8-really-that-bad">Windows 8</a> anyone?) In 2019 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Catalina#Catalyst">the ability to run iPad apps on the Mac was added to macOS</a>, but with a mouse and keyboard of course. Requiring a mouse and keyboard on the iPad would be more preferable approach and would keep the line between  ‘desktop’ and ‘mobile’, but it just doesn’t seem like something the Apple we all know would ever do. It’s too clunky having two versions of the same app.</p>
<p>Another option is to build upon iPad OS and address all the little things that make it difficult to use a full-time computing device. It has come a long way in the past 5 years since I wrote my original article, and many of the features I said were needed are now present in iPad OS. The difficulty now is that many of the things that make PC operating systems so powerful run counter to what makes the iPad so secure and simple to use. As we’ve seen from the iPad’s horrendous attempt to support multitasking, adding complexity to something that wasn’t originally designed for it is also difficult to pull off. Not forgetting, iPad OS also needs to run on the cheapest £329 iPad which has far less compute power than the iPad Air or iPad Pro. Anything that add adds more power for Pro users risks alienating the majority of casual users who just want a large smartphone for watching video browsing social media.</p>
<p>What really leaves a sour taste in the mouth is the fact that Apple now is now seemly selling the same computer in many different form-factors but is artificially limiting which software can run on them based on imaginary product categories.  There is no law of nature that says what a ‘tablet’ is any more than there one that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox">defines a number of grains of sand required before they can be called a mound</a>. Yet it is in Apple’s best interests to make sure customers have a reason to buy a Mac, an iPad <em>and</em> an iPhone. For a company that likes to boast how <em>good</em> it is by making sure we all know how much they support <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/environment/">good causes</a>, have they not thought of the <em>environmental impact</em> of millions of people deciding to buy both an iPad and a Mac when there is no reason other than Apple’s business model requiring they do so?</p>
<p>But Apple must have known that by naming the iPad’s processor ‘M1’ parallels would be drawn with the Mac, and questions would be asked. They could quite easily have called the CPU A14X, or A15, it’s just a marketing name after all. The fact they choose to draw a direct parallel with the Mac makes me think that Apple <em>do</em> have something up their sleeves to further bridge the gap between the iPad and Mac, and ensuring all that power does not go go waste. I don’t think the iPad will ever run macOS, but I can see a situation similar to how the Mac can currently run iPad apps, but in reverse. Imagine if when a keyboard and pointing device are plugged into the iPad, iPad apps that have been updated to support the Mac are able to run in full ‘Mac Mode’ on the iPad. Apps would be scaled down to simulate a higher resolution allowing more content to be shown with the assumption that a pointer, not a finger will be used for input. A menu bar would show across the top of the screen. It wouldn’t be “macOS” (it's not <em>the</em> menu bar), but it would provide a way for Mac-optimised apps to run in in a desktop-like mode. Additionally, if iPad OS could also provide a “Developer Mode” similar to how Macs let users <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208198">turn off secure boot</a> that allowed software be side-loaded (bypassing the App Store restrictions) and a way to use developer centric tools such as the Terminal and Homebrew, the iPad would suddenly become substantially more powerful. It still wouldn't be able to run the full version of Photoshop as many have asked for, but it would be a compromise that would offer a more powerful user experience while also seeking to encourage the likes of Adobe to port their ancient applications to Apple’s more modern UIKit frameworks, becoming iPad apps at the same time.</p>
<p>Is it a stretch? Yes. But giving the iPad the same processor as a Mac is a bold move, and that makes me hopeful that we can expect similarly bold moves from the software team over the coming year.</p>

      <title>Apple, Please Make It Easier To Report Scam Apps</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/04/18/apple-please-make-it-easier-to-report-scam-apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 06:04:55 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/04/18/apple-please-make-it-easier-to-report-scam-apps/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/img_8009.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>I was searching Apple's App Store for something and came across a bunch of apps from a developer who offers a suite of apps that seem designed to confuse customers into paying for in-app purchases and subscriptions under false pretences.</p>
<p>First there is a &quot;Find My AirPods&quot; type app which costs $4.99 a month and claims to be able to find Fitbit devices as well. Obviously this is a scam since this functionality is built into iOS and the APIs are not exposed to allow developers to even do this.</p>
<p>Next there is a <em>Among Us</em> wallpaper app with a £2.99 in-app purchase - questionable as it seems to be using intellectual property owned by the creators of Among Us, <em>Innersloth</em>. This app is however nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an app named &quot;Audacity&quot; that uses the same icon as the popular open source audio editor <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>. Only judging from the screenshots, it offers none of the functionality you would expect from its open source namesake and its privacy policy is hosted by Google Sites, not on audacityteam.org as one might expect. Unsurprisingly, this fake Audacity app costs £4.49 a month.</p>
<p>There is also a “count down to a day” app which on the face of it doesn’t seem like a scam, this is a useful piece of functionality and I use such an app myself. This countdown app costs a whopping £9.99 per month.</p>
<p>When responding to the case of a man who lost $600, 000 worth of bitcoin by using a scam app, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/bitcoin-scam-app-costs-iphone-user-life-savings/">claimed</a> that “<em>In the limited instances when criminals defraud our users, we take swift action against these actors as well as to prevent similar violations in the future</em>.”.</p>
<p>I am surprised that this developer has managed to get apps that use the names <em>AirPods</em>, <em>Among</em> <em>Us</em>, and <em>Audacity</em> through Apple’s review process since they are all well known brand names. While not directly comparable, when developing an Android app for a well-known global bank that was to be published in the Google Play Store, I had to have someone from the bank contact the Google Play review team to confirm I was authorised to publish an app that uses the bank’s name and logo. While the stakes here aren’t as high as a fake banking app, I would expect Apple to do something similar for apps related to popular games and open source software, not to mention apps using Apple’s own trademarks.</p>
<p>So how to report these seemingly dodgy apps to Apple? The only way I can find so far is to install an app first.</p>
<p>Yes that’s right - it’s only possible to report a problem with an app by going to your App Store purchase history page after purchasing or downloading it. There is no &quot;Report Suspicious App&quot; button on the App Store listing itself.</p>
<p>But who in their right mind would install software they suspect is dodgy? I understand that some people might inadvertently pay for scam apps and need a refund, but waiting until after the fact seems lazy of Apple.</p>

<p>A quick tip for iOS users. It’s possible to view the dB level that is currently being produced by your headphones at any time on iOS. This is useful if you want to make sure that your headphones don’t get too loud.</p>
<p>To view the decibel level, you’ll first need to add the “Hearing” widget to Control Centre. You can do this by going to the Control Centre menu within the Settings app. Once you’ve added <em>Hearing</em>, the next time you swipe open Control Centre and select the newly added widget, you will see live a dB meter beneath the name of your headphones.</p>

<p>If you listen to only one podcast this week then it should be the latest episode of <a href="https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/blog/2021/314-adam-curtis">Talking Politics featuring the great documentary film-maker Adam Curtis</a>. I recommend listening to the entire episode, the bit at the 29 minutes was of particular interest as he explores the modern Internet, whether online advertising can possibly work, and how peculiar it is that advertising is no longer an add-on to the economy but central to it. Curtis also likens mining 'Big Data' for hidden patterns and inferring causality to the way in which conspiracy theories work. This seems obvious in hindsight. Mind blown. If 48 minutes isn't enough, he also delves deeper into a lot of the material covered in the podcast in his new BBC documentary series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p093wp6h/cant-get-you-out-of-my-head">Can’t Get You Out of My Head</a>, which I also thoroughly recommend.</p>

      <title>20 Years of macOS</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/03/27/20-years-of-macos/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2021 18:01:04 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/03/27/20-years-of-macos/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It is 2021 and would you believe it, macOS is 20 years old. Like someone who found out about band before they became famous, I used Mac OS X back when it was a strangely futuristic operating system that most people had never heard of.</p>
<p>I left school in the summer of 2001 and to help jumpstart my journey into further education, I used some money gifted to me by my grandparents to buy a G3 Snow <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/07/summer-2001-imac-g3/">iMac</a>. Already a bit of a geek, I knew enough about Macs to know that they were now capable of running OS X, which was Unix based. This meant I could use it do geeky things like running Apache and PHP, and also write up college homework in Microsoft Office. Buying an G3 iMac in the summer of 2001 was also exceptionally poor timing because weeks later Apple would release an updated G4 model, which ran Mac OS X much more smoothly.</p>
<p>My early memories of Mac OS X were mainly of disappointment. Here was an exceedingly beautiful and stable operating system, but it was frustratingly slow. It would take many minutes to boot up, and simple tasks like opening a pulldown menu or resizing a window would cause it to chug. Until I received my <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/151808/25osx-2.html">free 10.1 upgrade</a> from John Lewis, it was unusable, and so I stuck with MacOS 9.</p>
<p>After installing 10.1 I did however start using Mac OS X as my main system. I recently found some old screenshots from that era, and so I thought it would be fun to take a look at some of the applications I was using 20 years ago. I’m not sure of the exact dates but I believe they are all from either 10.0 or 10.1. The screenshots were taken by <em>16 year old me</em>, so please forgive the embarrassing MSN Messenger friend lists and poorly written homework assignments.</p>
<p>Scouting around the screenshots, here’s what I was running in 2001:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macosx-desktop-2001-1.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>

<p>macOS in 2021</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activity Monitor</strong> - Still something I use often to see how my system is performing. Thankfully now it looks a lot nicer.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Reader</strong> - An awful piece of software, which is thankfully no longer needed on the Mac these days. In 2001, I must have thought it necessary, despite the Preview app being bundled with the OS.</p>
<p><strong>AOL</strong> - It was ugly, but it was one of the best unmetered dialup services in the UK at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Clock</strong> - Early versions of OS X included a clock ‘widget’. This wasn’t an official widget like we have now, nor was it the HTML based widgets we would later see in Dashboard. It was simply an application with a non-rectangular window. Best of all, it was possible to customise how translucent the clock was - a novelty in 2001.</p>
<p><strong>Fire</strong> - Before iChat, Fire was <em>the</em> app to use for accessing instant messaging platforms. ICQ, AIM, Yahoo - I was on all of them. The idea of instant messaging that emphasises online presence feels exceptionally dated now, since we are now always online.</p>
<p><strong>iCab</strong> - Back in 2001 decent web browsers were difficult to come by. There was no Safari yet. Internet Explorer was pretty good, and had the ability to customise its colour scheme to match the iMac being used.  There was also Mozilla, which was starting to become a usable alternative to IE, but was still extremely slow. iCab was the third option and the only one that really felt “OS X native”.  Astonishingly iCab is still available for download in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>iTunes</strong> - The first of Apple consumer high quality consumer oriented software that later included the likes of iPhoto and GarageBand. iTunes was in of itself a reason to own a Mac. It made the process of ripping and burning CDs painless. I remember the novel feeling of being able to browse the web while iTunes was burning a CD, thanks to Mac OS X’s ability to multitask. On Windows ME and 98 (XP had not been released yet) this wasn’t possible. Burning a CD would make the entire computer unresponsive. iTunes came in to its own with the release of the <a href="http://lostinlogic.com/2011/11/06/10-years-of-the-ipod/index.html">iPod</a>, which I was lucky enough to own early on too.</p>
<p><strong>MSN Messenger</strong> - More commonly known as simply ‘MSN’, it was the centre of my social life from the age of 13. I would use it to chat to friends after school or to random people I’d added who I’d met on <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/21/farewell-net-magazine/">forums</a>. I wonder if today we would be concerned if a 16 year old was talking to random people they’ve met online, but for me it was fine. At 16, I felt like I was an adult!</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Office</strong> - I purchased the full version of ‘Office X’ which included Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage. It was clearly a straight port from the classic MacOS version, and was using some kind of translation layer to translate Windows code to Mac code. I remember writing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to make full on Windows windows appear. The headline feature for Word was non-contiguous selection.</p>
<p><strong>Palm Desktop</strong> - This one really sums up 2001. Back then we had PDAs. My phone was a <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2013/09/12/my-history-in-phones/">Motorola T191</a>. If you wanted to have more than just a handful of phone numbers in your pocket, you needed a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). I would later upgrade my Palm IIIe to a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid04D--9DvAhWERxUIHcvfDdIQFjAAegQIAxAD&amp;url=https://imarc.co.uk/2003/07/24/hp-ipaq-2200-review/&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GYvY3K77yo8XDEmz_e_IV">Microsoft Pocket PC</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stickies</strong> - The venerable Post-it note app. Enough said.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal</strong> - I used to use this for learning basic Linux commands, and configuring the likes of PHP, Apache and MySQL. Oh, and browsing the web in Lynx, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Media Player</strong> - Steaming audio or video on the web was a horrible experience in 2001. Partly due to limited bandwidth, but also because there were multiple competing formats. Apple would push QuickTime. Microsoft would insist on you installing Windows Media Player, and everyone else would use RealPlayer. Windows Media Player for the Mac wasn’t the full-on media management solution it was on Windows, but merely a way to playback files encrypted using Microsoft’s DRM.</p>
<p>After 20 years, I really think Apple deserve enormous credit for not screwing up macOS. Despite some missteps, on the whole they’ve keep modernising it without any major regressions. If you were to sit someone from 2001 down in front of the latest version of the operating system in 2021, they would find their way around just fine. Yet it doesn’t feel old. Contrast this to Windows, which has had multiple makeovers and seems to be less of a priority for Microsoft these days, doesn’t support non-modal dialogs, and still has screens that date back to Windows XP. Not many operating systems can claim to be <a href="https://youtu.be/6gezrVPZHZA?t=176">referenced in a U2 song either.</a> After all these years, macOS is still the only desktop operating system that feels like it’s made for users, rather than IT administrators or developers. Little things like being able to drag a project folder to the dock for the duration of that project in order to have easy access to all the related files, the ability to <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/working-with-windows-in-the-background">operate a background window without bringing it to the foreground</a>, and best of all, the varied ecosystem of <a href="http://netnewswireapp.com">indie software</a>.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Mac OS X, here's to 20 more years!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/23/citigroup-ceo-ordains-zoom-free-fridays-to-ease-relentless-pandemic-workday">The Guardian</a> on Citigroup banning internal video calls on Fridays::</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global investment bank Citigroup has banned work video calls on Fridays in an attempt to help employees break free from the “relentlessness of the pandemic workday”.</p>
<p>Jane Fraser, Citi’s new chief executive, told staff that the last day of the working week would be known as “Zoom-free Fridays”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is in the context of what appears to be an unhealthy workaholic culture over at Citigroup, but it's still interesting to see more and more people coming to the view that video calls <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/28/time-to-turn-off-video-to-avoid-online-meeting-fatigue/">aren't always the right form of communication</a>.</p>
<p>Here's The Verge's Nilay Patel:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1371873243045433344</p>
<p>Once it is safe to go back to the office, I can see myself and others opting to go in for meetings once or twice a week, while remaining at home the rest of the time to get work done. In this world video calls become increasingly unnecessary. It also sets a clear boundary between discussing getting work done, and <em>actually</em> getting work done, which might be quite illuminating.</p>

      <title>Saying Goodbye to Podcast &quot;Subscriptions&quot;</title>

<p>Apple is ditching the word 'Subscribe' as a means to describe the act of telling your favourite podcast player to keep checking a particular feed and have the latest episode available at a moment's notice. Instead it will use &quot;Follow&quot;, which seems to make a lot more sense as a way represent passively consuming a feed at no cost. <em>Subscribe</em> is one of those words that predates podcasts, I remember &quot;subscribing&quot; to newsgroups as a teenager and worrying that my parents were going to receive a bill for it. They never did.</p>
<p>My bet is the etymology comes from email mailing lists, where I think the word <em>subscribe</em> still makes sense. Funnily enough, in 2021 email mailing lists are having something of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/25/new-cue-former-q-editors-join-newsletter-publishing-boom">renaissance</a>. With paid newsletters being <em>in</em>, and advertising being <em>out</em>, I also expect this change will be because Apple will be pushing paid podcasts, where the word <em>subscribe</em> does make sense.</p>

      <title>Monetising Hobbies</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/03/12/monetising-hobbies/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:42:13 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/03/12/monetising-hobbies/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/marc-running.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p><em>That's me (right) - want your logo on display?</em></p>
<p>I am looking for ways to monetise my running.  I usually run 5 kilometres a couple of times during the week and a longer 10 mile (16.10K) run at the weekend. This is a heavy time investment. The 5K runs take between 22 and 30 minutes depending on the weather, my energy levels and the incline of the route. Similarly, the 10 mile run takes usually takes around 1 hour and 26 minutes from my Sunday. This may seem like a small slice of the weekend, but I have to make sure I get up extra early and eat a good breakfast and then wait for a couple of hours before I’m ready to start pounding the pavement. On my return, I need a shower, followed by a long recovery period which involves eating again and then sitting still for a few hours. There are other costs too; a decent pair of running shoes costs between £100 and £120, and only last a year. I could pay less, but I like to support smaller, specialist running shops rather than the likes of Sports Direct. I also need shoes that offer strong support due to the weird way I run which increases the price still. Not forgetting too the copious amount of pasta and other carbohydrates I have to consume. Running costs more than you'd think.</p>
<p>All this has led me to the conclusion that I need to find a way to earn some extra cash from my running.</p>
<p>This post is of course, not at all serious. No, I am not looking for anyone to pay me to do the thing I enjoy. Just as I wouldn’t expect to be paid to go climbing, canoeing, golfing, or to watch a film at the cinema. It’s fine to have an interest that you don’t make money from. I never expect to make money from this blog. It is something I do because I enjoy it. <em>It’s a hobby</em>. I won’t go as far as to say I should be paying <em>you</em> to read it, but I do expect to pay a small amount for WordPress hosting, and to put a few hours a week into writing content.</p>
<p>The reason I’m writing this is because I’ve noticed a theme in various podcasts, blogs and YouTube channels that I've come across recently that some creators who are doing the thing they love and not as their sole means of income are expressing their dissatisfaction at not being able to monetise what is essentially a hobby. I use the term &quot;hobby&quot; not in a derogatory sense - indeed the fact that many creators are not a full on professionals is what gives some of my favourite podcasts and YouTube channels their charm.</p>
<p>Of course I'm not saying creators shouldn't <em>try</em> to make money, and some professionals will of course rely on their creative output as their main source of income. For many of us however, maybe a hobby is just fine? We can't all be <em>The Verge</em>. Just I’m never going to be competing at running with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Farah">Mo Farah</a>, not everyone will end up as successful as the podcast <em><a href="https://atp.fm/sponsor">ATP</a></em>.</p>
<p>If you enjoy the process of creating, and giving something away to an audience, then maybe that's payment enough?</p>

      <title>M1 Macs Really Are ‘Always-On’</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/03/02/m1-macs-really-are-always-on/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 20:01:53 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/03/02/m1-macs-really-are-always-on/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5AwdkGKmZ0I?t=723"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/m1-always-on.png?w=1024" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Apple's new M1 Macs use the same 'always-on' processor technology that mobile devices have been using for years. It has always been imperative that a mobile phone must be permanently sitting and listening, waiting for a call or message to come in, so it can sound the ringtone. Modern tablets such as the iPad evolved from this line of thinking and so are naturally <em>always-on</em> too.</p>
<p>Laptops and Desktops have however have never taken this route. Recent versions of Windows and macOS will wake up periodically to perform certain tasks, or in response network events, but I've never noticed them doing much in realtime.</p>
<p>I was surprised then to notice that my new M1 MacBook, while apparently asleep, was busy running rules on incoming mail seconds after it had arrived. My phone buzzes as a new email is received, and I open the mail app on my phone to see the message has been flagged, moved or whatever else I have set as a rule on my Mac. This would happen with my old 2013 MacBook, but the rules would only run every few hours. It's not a bug as far as I can tell, as the battery life when the MacBook is sleeping is still outstanding. I'm yet to explore how this works, or how much 3rd party developers can take advantage of this <em>always-on</em> state, but the possibility of having powerful devices, which aren't locked down in the same way as iPads and iPhones, performing <em>useful</em> tasks in near realtime while using hardly any battery, is pretty exciting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> As of macOS 11.3, Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896">restored hibernation support</a> to M1 Macs. Hibernation mode is a lower power state Mac laptops go into after being asleep for around 3 hours. I’ve not noticed any difference in behaviour yet, let me know about your experience in the comments.</p>

      <title>Time to Turn Off Video to Avoid Online Meeting Fatigue?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/28/time-to-turn-off-video-to-avoid-online-meeting-fatigue/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3755755.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Researchers at Stanford have <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/">identified four causes of what they call &quot;Zoom fatigue&quot;</a></strong>. They all resonate with me as someone who has a lot of online meetings,. (Though I'm not keen on the attempt to turn &quot;Zoom&quot; into a generic noun!)</p>
<p>I recommend reading the article in full, but the four causes boil down to <em><strong>excessive eye contact,</strong></em> <strong><em>always seeing yourself</em>,</strong> <strong><em>reduced mobility</em>,</strong> and <em><strong>higher cognitive load</strong></em> due to the fact it's difficult to interpret body language. The solutions offered range from suggestions on how conference software could be adapted to taking regular &quot;audio only&quot; breaks.</p>
<p>Seeing people is great, and a necessary part of working together, but once the the initial greetings are done, it adds little value most of time, in my experience at least. Thankfully Microsoft Teams lets you hide <em>other people's video</em> as well as your own. Back when I used to work in the office, I would often pace up and down while on calls with clients, and studies have shown we are more intelligent and creative when we're moving. Now though, as the Stanford team point out, we are all sat in chairs, staring at each other directly in the eyes all day.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that video is useful when you're meeting people for the first time and trying to form a connection with them, or for calls where you really want to gauge the other person's true feelings about something. But for meetings that require excessive brainpower or creativity, it's probably worth switching off video and going for a walk.</p>

      <title>Moving Away From LastPass Premium</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/26/moving-away-from-lastpass-premium/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 11:46:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/26/moving-away-from-lastpass-premium/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>LastPass made headlines recently because it's stripping back its free offering and asking users to pay for features that were once bundled for free.</p>
<p>I've been a paid LastPass subscriber for over 5 years, and over that time it has become a critical part of both my professional and home workflows. The problem is the issues it had 5 years ago are still problems now. The product seemingly hasn't moved forward much at all. LastPass has a fundamental misunderstanding of basic User Interface design principals. It looks awful and is difficult to use. Each app behaves differently on different platforms, and features are shoehorned in with little regard to the expected user workflow. How many times have I searched for a site, copied the username, only to have to <em>search for the site again</em> in order to copy the password. Errors are frequent, when generating a new password I always end up pasting it into a text editor temporarily in case LastPass fails to save it. It's also incredibly slow, even on 2020 Intel i5 processor.</p>
<p>I mention this because I recently helped a friend migrate from LastPass's free offering to Apple's iCloud Keychain. Compared so LastPass, iCloud is so much <em>nicer</em> to user. I understand LastPass are at a disadvantage in trying to make their product fit into the ecosystems of Apple and Google, but it made me think about switching. Now Apple have made an official way to access <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/icloud/mmfeee20145e/1.0/icloud/1.0">iCloud passwords on Windows</a>, I'm seriously thinking about switching. To their credit LastPass do make it easy to get a CSV export of all your data.</p>
<p>What's your experience with iCloud Keychain? Is it worth switching to from LastPass Premium?</p>

      <title>Chrome Uses More RAM by Design</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 10:21:59 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/26/chrome-uses-more-ram-by-design/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Great <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/yes-chrome-uses-more-ram-than-safari-but-how-much-more/">video by Matt</a> that shows that Chrome isn't always <em>that</em> different to Safari in its memory consumption as others <a href="https://www.flotato.com/post/memory-chrome-safari-flotato">have found</a>. Most of my daily collaboration is done using Microsoft Teams, which is an Electron app - <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/05/microsoft-is-replacing-the-outlook-app-with-a-web-app/">which is to say a web application bundled in its own Chromium wrapper so it can run like a desktop application</a>. I've often noticed Microsoft Teams takes up <em>huge</em> amounts of RAM, especially considering it's not really doing anything that complicated most of the time. A while back I researched phenomena and found this article about <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-memory-usage-perf">how Chromium manages memory</a></strong> on Microsoft's site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chromium detects how much system memory is available and utilizes enough of that memory to optimize the rendering experience. When other apps or services require system memory, Chromium gives up memory to those processes. Chromium tunes Teams memory usage on an ongoing basis in order to optimize Teams performance without impacting anything else currently running.<br>
…<br>
When computers have more memory, Teams will use that memory. In systems where memory is scarce, Teams will use less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put simply, Chrome is taking the idea that <em>'empty RAM is wasted RAM'</em>, and running with it. The article goes on to link to the specific documentation from the Chromium project.</p>
<p>This reminds me of when Windows Vista came out, complete with a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/windows-vista-sidebar.jpg">sidebar full of widgets</a>. One of the default widgets showed CPU and RAM usage. At the time I was working in my local computer retailer, and remember customers being shocked that even with no applications running, Windows Vista was often using 40% of the available RAM, even on higher spec'd machines. Of course Windows was doing a smart thing by pre-loading applications likely to be used into memory so they could be launched faster, and so it was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Chrome's philosophy has long been that <em>it is an operating system for the web</em> - it even has its own task manager. So it makes sense from that perspective to grab as much memory as possible, and use it to speed things up for users. For users who spend most of their day inside Chrome, it's probably doing them a favour. The problem is that these days we often end up running multiple instances of Chrome or Chromium derived apps like Slack or Teams competing alongside each other for system resources.</p>
<p>As Matt shows, the difference between Safari isn't always that much, but the important thing to remember is that Chrome's memory usage will depend on how much overall memory your system has <em>available</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some advanced users have been reporting an overuse of the SSD for writing and reading data on the newly-released Macs with M1, Apple’s first computer chip based on ARM architecture. The issue could eventually affect the lifespan of the internal SSD used in M1 Macs — not to mention the machine itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My betting is on this being a bug in the software being used to measure SSD usage (a utility called <strong><a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/smartmontools">smartmontools</a></strong> that can be installed via <a href="http://brew.sh"><strong>Homebrew</strong></a>). SSD usage seems like something that should be pretty easy to automate testing for, and so for this to be a bug would be a major omission from Apple's test suite. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/29/macos-high-sierra-bug-apple-mac-unlock-blank-password-security-flaw">Not impossible of course</a>.</p>

<p>Riccardo Mori has written <a href="http://morrick.me/archives/9150">a thoroughly enjoyable critique</a> of the the latest macOS user interface design. This passage in particular made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mac’s user interface is undergoing plastic surgery by the hand of surgeons who have studied on iOS books. The result is pretty much the same as when you see a favourite celebrity after a procedure. They look ‘younger’ but there’s also something weird about their appearance. Their traits have changed a bit. In certain cases you almost fail to recognise the person at first glance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've not upgraded my aging 2013 MacBook Air just yet, but I've experienced Big Sur when briefly using my girlfriend's laptop. I agree there is something that feels slightly 'off' about the new design. Even small details, like the fact that the new control centre glyph looks like a set of miniature switches - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/buttons/switches/">which are a UI components themselves</a>. Whether the new UI will grown on me as iOS 7's did (I was an iOS 6 holdout for many months) will depend on how much Apple refine the new look over the coming months a years, as they did with iOS. Perhaps my <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/22/macos-big-finger/">theory</a> will one day hold true, that Big Sur's big surprise is that it will support touch screens after all.</p>
<p>My fondest memories of Mac OS X was probably Puma. This was a free updated related after 10.0's abysmal stability and performance problems. I remember picking it up for free from John Lewis. (In lieu of an Apple Store - there were none in the UK at the time - they were the one of the few places to get such things.) Back then Mac OS X seemed like a new frontier in user interface design. Here is what 16 year old me's desktop looked like in 2002:</p>

<p>The Fitness app in 2016 vs 2021</p>
<p>Lee asks <em><a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/02/04/are-apple-ruining-user-experience-to-promote-their-own-services/">Are Apple ruining user experience to promote their own services?</a></em> - While using the Fitness app earlier today it occurred to me that the answer is most definitely <em>yes!</em> The current incarnation of the Fitness app (formally known as Activity) now squashes in <em>Activity History</em>, <em>current day</em>, <em>workout lists</em>, <em>awards</em>, and the recently added <em>trends</em> functionality into a single tab. Only <em>Sharing</em> and their brand new premium service, <em>Fitness+</em> get their own tab, and the cynic in me thinks even <em>Sharing</em> is only there because it helps sell Apple Watches to friends and family.</p>
<p>Really, Fitness+ should be its own app, but that would make it easy to delete and forget about. Instead, Apple who were once leaders in user interface design (so much that they call it <em>human interface</em>), are using an entire tab (one whole third of the total tabs) to show a service many people (I'd wager <em>most</em>) won't use. The original app was a joy to use, but the latest one just feels crowded. I hope Apple can find a way to promote services without lowering their famous user experience standards.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Great article <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22273071/podcast-moderation-apple-spotify-podbean-steve-bannon?__twitter_impression=true">over on The Verge</a>, but I have one small issue with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking it <em>[Apple]</em> to remove a show from its directory is like asking it to make a specific webpage inaccessible in Safari — is that something people want? Podcasting has, so far, avoided crowning one platform as king, meaning anyone, both on the creator and business side, can enter the space and possibly find success in it. That’s what makes podcasting great, even if it requires unclear answers on moderation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web browser analogy is close - podcasts are just audio files uploaded to web servers - but there's a key difference. Apple (or any company) deciding to not include a podcast in its directory is not the same as blocking its URL outright. It is more akin to Google not showing certain web pages in its search results (which it does all the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">especially in the EU</a>). This is very different to your browser refusing to load a particular web address because the browser maker has decided it doesn't think you should see the content.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the Apple's Podcasts app, you can either search a directory to find a show, or enter its feed URL manually. (Any app that doesn't support adding feeds manually is arguably not a <em>podcast</em> app - I'm looking at you <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Partners-Web-Player-etc/adding-podcast-by-url-why-can-t-spotify-answer-this-question/td-p/4662156">Spotify</a>.) Adding a podcast by URL is how most paid podcasts work, and is the podcast equivalent of typing <em>https://nodejs.org</em> instead of Googling <em>NodeJS</em>.</p>
<p>For better or worse I can see Apple expanding its moderation role for its podcast directory, but just as with the web, eager listeners will always be able to find shows from some other source and enter the URL manually. This is an inherent strength of podcasting, which unlike Twitter and YouTube, is not subject to the same <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/youtubes-recommendation-algorithm-has-a-dark-side/">algorithmic recommendation spirals</a>.</p>

      <title>The BBC Is Using Its Own ‘Dot BBC’ Domain</title>

      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/13/the-bbc-is-using-its-own-dot-bbc-domain/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the.bbc-domain.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>The BBC has started using its own custom <a href="http://nic.bbc">Top Level Domain (TLD</a>). The entire BBC Online offering is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220112002616/https://the.bbc/">https://the.bbc</a> <em>[Update March 2022 - this link no longer works, so I've updated it with an archive.org link]</em>. Many large corporations such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/tld/">Apple</a> and <a href="http://nic.tkmaxx">T.K. Maxx</a> own their own TLD, which were rumoured to cost around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/icann-to-expand-top-level-domain-names-applications-start-jan-12-2012/?guccounter=1">$185,000</a>.</p>
<p>Currently the site doesn't seem to have officially switched as some components such as video and sign-in appear to be broken, and the site's canonical URL is still set to use the old domain. However the fact that someone has configured the new one along with its own TLS certificate might be a sign that the Beeb is thinking of switching from their iconic <em>bbc.co.uk</em> address.</p>
<p>I suspect for many Internet users of a certain age, the web address <em>http://www.bbc.co.uk</em> was one of the very first they diligently typed into their computer back in the late nineties. The BBC's use of <em>.co.uk</em> paved the way for this TLD to become the de facto for UK-based companies. To switch now may well commence the beginning of the end for <em>.co.uk</em> being the standard for companies in the UK. While not every company can afford the fee for their own TLD, there are now many others, from <em>.mortgage</em> to <em>.furniture</em> to choose from. The problem is few well-known brands actually use them. Perhaps this might change soon.</p>
<p>For me there is something about newer TLDs that make them less likely to stand out as web site addresses. If I saw <em>weather.bbc</em> or <em>visit.london</em> written somewhere, I wouldn't necessarily think to visit them in a web browser, whereas anything ending in <em>.com</em> or <em>.co.uk</em> etc. is obviously a web address.</p>

      <title>Working From Home in a Small Apartment</title>

<p><em>You don't need to spend lots to be productive.</em></p>
<p>My girlfriend and I are currently trying to move to a bigger house, but with a global pandemic it has been a slow process. Hence we are currently both working from our 1 bedroom flat and are likely to continue this way for the next few months. Both our jobs involve lots of online calls, and so after a many weeks sitting uncomfortably at opposite ends of the dining room table I decided there must be a better way. For 5' 11&quot; me the table was uncomfortable, even if my shorter girlfriend felt it was fine for her. Really though, being within earshot each other all day was starting to grate on us both. With her piano taking up a sizeable chunk of our living room, there was no space for a desk anywhere else.</p>
<p>So over the past few weeks I set about making the working day more productive and ergonomic. <strong>Astonishingly, for about £70 I was able to get a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01D0BSO44?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details">foldable desk</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07C9MMZ9P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">laptop stand</a> from Amazon.</strong></p>
<p>While there are lots of foldable desks available online, many of them are either too wide or didn't have the depth required for comfortable typing. Eventually I found one that has enough space for the laptop stand, keyboard and all-important wrist rest. These, along with my company issued Dell XPS 9500 and existing Apple Magic Keyboard, Microsoft ergonomic mouse and basic office chair have helped increase my productivity and comfort no end. (I recommended the programme <em><a href="https://magicutilities.net/">Magic Utilities</a></em> for getting Apple's Magic Keyboard to work with Windows.) I set the desk up in the corridor, and at the end of the day, I simply fold away the desk and the space is regained.</p>
<p>Hopefully once we've moved I will be able to have a nicer desk and multiple monitor setup, but for now this inexpensive solution that cost a little over £70 (and would work with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/CiT-USB-Keyboard-Mouse-Combo/dp/B00647IDCU/ref=sr_1_3?crid=P75NBS3BYYHJ&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=basic+mouse+and+keyboard&amp;qid=1612473539&amp;sprefix=basic+mouse+and+%2Caps%2C148&amp;sr=8-3">cheap £10 keyboard and mouse</a> if you don't already have them) has been a valuable pandemic investment. Contrast this with the narrative from some tech podcasters and bloggers who would have you think that you need to spend lots of money to be productive. You really don't.</p>

      <title>Making Siri Timers More Timely</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/01/making-siri-timers-more-timely/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 21:06:05 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/01/making-siri-timers-more-timely/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/siri-icon.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>I can be a perfectionist when it comes to software, and one thing that bugs me when using Siri timers is the fact that the time taken for Siri to understand me is added on to the timer duration.</p>
<p>Frequently I will start a timer using the &quot;Hey Siri&quot; wake word, either using my Apple Watch or iPhone. Depending on where I am in the house and general WiFi signal, the time it takes for Siri to respond can range from a few seconds to 10 or more.</p>
<p>From the time between saying &quot;Hey Siri&quot; and completing the sentence &quot;Set a timer for 5 minutes.&quot; the device will upload the audio to a server, which will use a set of speech-to-text machine learning models to predict the words said. It will then use a natural language model to classify this text into an intent, deriving meaning from the sentence.</p>
<p>In many cases, this results in my 5 minute timer not going off 5 minutes after I decided I wanted to start a timer, but 5 minutes and 7 seconds after.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way however. The device presumably knows the exact time it successfully detected a &quot;Hey Siri&quot; command (a <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri">complex set of systems in their own right</a>), and so it could simply deduct this from the requested timer duration. If Siri takes 7 seconds to figure out what I meant, then my 5 minute timer becomes a 4 minutes and 53 seconds timer.</p>
<p>A small request, but if any company could pay attention to small features like this, it's Apple.</p>

      <title>A New Age of Web Censorship?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/16/a-new-age-of-web-censorship/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2021 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/16/a-new-age-of-web-censorship/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Opinions are understandably mixed as to whether it was right for Twitter, Facebook et al. to remove Donald Trump's various accounts from their servers. Amazon blocking access to the prominent alternative Parler, which was welcoming Trump and his followers with open arms was also questionable. There is a genuine debate to be had about whether this all amounts to censorship, or is simply businesses wanting to restrict illegal or unsavoury content.</p>
<p>Since the days of Geocities I remember it being common for web hosts to have clauses in their Terms of Service that prohibit certain content. In fact, here is a snippet from the Geocities TOS in 2000:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You agree to not use the Service to: a. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous**<em>[sic]</em>**, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050929192330/http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register?.intl=us&amp;new=1&amp;.done=http://geocities.yahoo.com/home/&amp;.src=geo&amp;partner=&amp;promo=&amp;.last=http://geocities.yahoo.com/join/cgi-bin/addrselection">Geocities, 2000</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put simply, Donald Trump would have been banned from Geocities too. Of course AWS is a far cry from Geocities, and in 2021 the online world is far more entangled with the offline that it was in the year 2000. However, I still think important to understand that web hosts not wanting to host certain content is nothing new.</p>
<p>This is where the concept of Net Neutrality is important. While I think it's fine for AWS to not want to <em>host</em> certain content, it would be a sad day for the Internet if ISPs could choose not to <em>carry traffic</em> for sites they find objectionable.</p>

      <title>What Is a Console?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/09/what-is-a-console/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 18:22:40 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/09/what-is-a-console/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/isnotacomputer.jpg?w=800" alt=""></p>
<p>Is a console…?</p>
<p>I was recently listening to John Gruber and Rene Ritchie speaking on an episode of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2020/12/24/ep-304">The Talk Show</a>. They both make the argument that by calling an iOS device a <em>console</em>, it somehow justifies Apple's position that the only way to load software onto it should be via their App Store. <a href="https://overcast.fm/+B7NDhvVMk/1:57:44">Have a listen</a>. While I have a huge amount of respect for both John and Rene, I think this is a poor take. John even admitted that this was probably his most controversial take of 2020, and I'm not surprised.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the definition of the word &quot;console&quot; from the Oxford American English Dictionary, courtesy of Apple's own dictionary app:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/define_console.png?w=541" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, none of these definitions bring to mind a device that anyone could sincerely claim encapsulates an iPad or an iPhone. The definition of a <em>console</em> is not <em>&quot;A locked-down computing device.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Definitions aside, there is a point to be made that many people seem to find it acceptable that games consoles are closed ecosystems but have a problem when it comes to smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>I believe this disparity is for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Games console hardware is subsidised by charging more for software. There's a reason games consoles are more popular than gaming PCs, yet PC games have traditionally been sold at cheaper prices than their console counterparts. Many more people can afford to buy the latest Xbox because it is likely sold at cost, or even as a loss-lead. The manufacturer will hope to make up for lost profit by selling games later on. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model">razor-blade economics</a>.) While this method of selling a product is frustrating in the case of printers and ink cartridges, it turns out that many people don't mind when they get a high performance gaming computer as part of the bargain. My bet is that because buying games is something you opt into, rather than being forced into, you don't feel so cheated by having to pay a premium for the software. (Unlike razors and ink cartridges, you never feel like you need to buy a new game to keep your games console working.) Apple on the other hand makes enormous amounts of margin on each device sale <em>and</em> takes a cut of all software sold through the store. It may be legal and it may be in the spirit of capitalism, but that doesn't mean it won't rub customers the wrong way.</li>
<li>Apple has long marketed iOS devices as being more than mere handsets or consoles. As long ago as 2016, Apple's then marketing chief Phil Schiller <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/22/phil-schiller-old-windows-pcs/">noted</a> that there was a huge market for the iPad in people switching from old Windows PCs. In a 2017 iPad advertisement they used the slogan &quot;What is a computer?&quot;. Inferring that the iPad, while not looking like a traditional laptop, is in fact a powerful computer. In one scene a <a href="https://youtu.be/pI-iJcC9JUc?t=49">boy is sat outside on his iPad when his mum asks</a> <em>What are you doing on your computer?</em> The boy replies by asking <em>What's a computer?</em> He does not say <em>Actually Mum it's a console, not a computer</em>. Even The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18103515/ipad-pro-replace-your-computer-ad-apple">wrote the headline</a> in 2018 <em>Apple really wants you to think the iPad Pro is a computer</em>. More recent commercials have used wordplay such as <em>Your next computer is not a computer</em>. When introducing the iPhone in 2007, Steve Jobs noted that it ran OS X with &quot;desktop class&quot; software and that Safari could show the full web, not the &quot;baby Internet&quot;. Contrary to what Ritchie <a href="https://overcast.fm/+B7NDhvVMk/1:58:18">said</a> on The Talk Show, Steve Jobs absolutely did not introduce the iPhone as a console. (A search of <a href="https://singjupost.com/steve-jobs-iphone-2007-presentation-full-transcript/?singlepage=1">2007 iPhone keynote transcript</a> for the word returns zero results*.) Over the years, Apple has set the expectation that iOS devices should be on par with real computers, and for many, that means freedom to install software from any source you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I'm not advocating Apple open up their devices to software from anywhere, I do think it's right that the pros and cons are properly framed. There are benefits just as there are drawbacks. My view is that for the iPad in particular to evolve, it must be a device in which you can not only <em>play</em> the latest chart topping game, but also <em>make</em> the next one.</p>
<p><em>* Update 11/01/2021: My mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/VQKMoT-6XSg?t=4570">Steve Jobs did actually mention</a> games consoles during the 2007 iPhone keynote alongside digital cameras, MP3 Players and PCs. He talks about their comparative worldwide unit sales. What's interesting is that all of the product categories in the chart he shows (below) have in 2021 either been entirely replaced, or replaced in-part by iOS devices, except arguably the PC. Regardless, it's clear <strong>he is in no way calling the iPhone a console.</strong></em></p>

      <title>Microsoft Is Replacing Outlook With a Web App</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/05/microsoft-is-replacing-the-outlook-app-with-a-web-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 20:51:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/05/microsoft-is-replacing-the-outlook-app-with-a-web-app/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/project-monarch-outlook-web-universal-email-client-microsoft">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is planning to replace the aging native Outlook apps for both Windows and Mac with a <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Chromium-wrapped HTML app</a>. I came across this link thanks to John Gruber, whose <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/04/bowden-outlook">take on it</a> is unsurprisingly negative - within the Mac community there is a definite preference for native over web software over web apps.</p>
<p>While I am inclined to agree - native software can often be superior to web software, it really depends on the UI framework being used. Outlook for Windows has a codebase that dates back to at least 1997, and so is likely using the Microsoft Foundation Classes, which themselves date back to 1992. Age itself is not the issue - Apple's own Cocoa framework derives much from early 90s NeXTSTEP technologies. The difference is Apple have constantly updated Cocoa, whereas Microsoft have instead introduced a series of new frameworks that never took off (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms">here</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform_apps">here</a>) and using them would have meant rewriting much of the Outlook codebase. This means the latest version of Outlook in 2021 still operates very much like a piece of software from the mid-2000s. Searching a few thousand emails causes Outlook to stop responding on a latest generate Intel i7.</p>
<p>So given where Microsoft are, with no decent, modern and mature UI framework for Windows, what are the Outlook team supposed to do? Their biggest competitors are Gmail, Slack and Microsoft's own Teams - all web apps. They could spend the next 3 years rewriting the native app in a new UI framework, or they could utilise the already feature rich web app and spend the next 3 years building competitive features. Chromium based apps are also slow, but they're faster than a poorly written native apps. It's a crappy situation, but I think they've made a pragmatic choice.</p>
<p>Of course if Outlook were Mac-only then it would be a no-brainier. The difficult choice would be between AppKit and UIKit.</p>

      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2021/01/02/nurturing-your-default-network/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">Default Network</a> is a pattern of neurons that fire when you are not actively concentrating on anything. It's what we call <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428691-900-daydream-your-way-to-creativity/">daydreaming</a>. It has been <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23431260-200-how-to-daydream-your-way-to-better-learning-and-concentration/">linked to creativity</a> and our ability to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3553600/">reflect on the past, and prepare for the future</a>. Yet with so many distractions at our fingertips, it's easy to forego daydreaming under the guise of 'being productive' or simply wanting to counter boredom. This is not an original thought by any means. I am yet to read <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42771901-how-to-do-nothing">How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy</a></em> but it appears to talk about this phenomena (and it's on my reading list).</p>
<p>I think back to before I had a smartphone. I would sit at a bus stop waiting and just <em>think.</em> 20 minutes could go by where I would often do nothing except listen to music and watch the world go by. Of course there would be often be times when I had a book, magazine, or a game of <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/snake-nokia-6110-oral-history-taneli-armanto">snake</a> to help pass the time - but I certainly let my mind wander more than I do now.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I recently made a few changes to my iPhone setup that I have so far found to be beneficial to my overall mood and happiness levels:</p>
<p><em><strong>Delete News</strong> <strong>apps</strong></em>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/17/steven-pinker-media-negative-news">The media always makes the world seem worse that it really is</a>. If a plane lands successfully we don't consider it news. If a plane crashes, then it's news. Not having my default cure for boredom being to pick up my phone and open The Guardian or BBC News has freed my mind to think about more worthwhile things. Reading the news and being aware of current events is an important and many would say an essential aspect to living in a democracy, but reading it constantly is not necessary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fewer Podcasts</em></strong>: Podcasts are a wonderful form of entertainment. They are the perfect for introverts: conversation with no response required. I find myself listening to them when I'm walking, <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/25/running-metrics-on-apple-watch/">running</a>, doing household and garden chores, and even when falling asleep. Yet I've recently started to realise that this isn't a necessarily a good thing, and reading this <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/01/02/being-more-intentional-keeping-distractions-off-your-smartphone/">recent post</a> helped me solidify the thought. While some podcasts can be informative, and pure entertainment is important, there's only so much I need. I've recently tried to just 'do nothing' as I do the washing up or go for a walk, and while it initially felt strange, I have now actually started to enjoyed it. I won't be going cold turkey: 10 mile runs without any distraction are not on the cards just yet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Separate business email:</em></strong> About a month ago I was sitting down to relax at the end of a long day and my phone pinged. It was an email from my gas and electricity company telling me that my bill had increased three-fold. It made me think how odd it was that my utility company is able to reach me at 10pm at night. Thankfully days later I found out that the increase was simply because I'd been bit lax with submitting my meter readings and they'd made a poor estimate, but nevertheless it spurred me into taking action to prevent such intrusions happening again. I separated out business from personal email, and not just my work and personal email (those were of course already separated) - I've setup separate accounts for my private 'business' related subjects. Anything to do with my property, utilities, TV Licence, car etc. goes to the 'business' account. Anything fun and relaxing - mainly emails from family and friends and newsletters go to the personal account. Only the personal account is on my phone. I check my business account two or three times a day, and times of my choosing. Sometimes I don't check it for days, and I'm much happier for it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Media</em></strong>: I've <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/09/making-the-apple-watch-less-stress-inducing/">written about</a> this before so I won't belabour the point. Much like deleting News apps from my phone helped rein in the 'default' behaviour of reading the news when bored, deleting social media apps from my phone did the same. I found a <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/10/11/keeping-up-to-date-with-twitter-without-using-twitter/">nice trick</a> that allows me to incorporate a few Twitter accounts into my RSS feeds. Without the temptation to 'like' or 'retweet' and with no algorithm recommending content in attempt to try and increase my engagement, I find I get the benefits of Twitter (access to knowledge and opinions I wouldn't have otherwise had) but without many of the downsides (which are <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224">well documented</a>).</p>
<p>Those are my tweaks for 2021 and they won't of course work for everyone. There are no doubt times when we <em>need to be distracted</em> and it's <em>good</em> for our mental health. In those cases, I'm going to try reading books, listening to audiobooks or even getting back into coding. Let me know if you have tried any of the above or have any other recommendations.</p>

      <title>Tech Themes for 2021</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/31/tech-themes-for-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:00:25 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/31/tech-themes-for-2021/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>2020 was such an unpredictable year, but hopefully 2021 will be much better. In terms of the big themes for technology, here are my thoughts on what is likely to be on our collective minds over the next year.</p>
<h2>Regulation,  Regulation, Regulation</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/london-2021.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>The Internet is about to get more regulated, and it's long overdue. Whether it will be done right is still to be seen. Recent attempts (such as EU cookie banners) have missed the mark and not achieved anything except ruining the web experience for everyone. The UK Government is set to introduce an &quot;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/online-harms-white-paper">online harms</a>&quot; bill which, on the face of it looks positive: an internet with less online harm has to be much better than the current state of social media right now. However I have two concerns. One being that an ever-widening definition of &quot;harm&quot; might lead to overzealous censorship, though the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/online-harms-white-paper#the-harms-in-scope">list of harms</a> it seeks to cover seems very reasonable. The second is the burden placed on platforms. We saw with GDPR that some US sites (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/25/gdpr-us-based-news-websites-eu-internet-users-la-times">such as the LA Times</a>) simply blocked access to EU visitors as dealing with GDPR wasn't worth their effort. California later implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">its own regulation</a> similar to GDPR which meant many US sites ended up relenting and complied with GDPR. Might the same happen here? Additionally, would a company like Twitter have been able to flourish with the burden of huge fines for not policing content? If not (and I think likely not); will this legislation end up cementing the place of the current social media platforms as gatekeepers, making it harder for startups to compete? Will we simply see groups who get banned from the major platforms move to less centralised systems? $10/month gets you a Linux box from Linode, or for those with a decent uplink, a Raspberry Pi, either of those running <a href="https://www.discourse.org">Discourse</a> could suffice as a small scale alternative to the big platforms. What happens then? Are hosting companies and ISPs also responsible for enforcing moderation? While I think it's a good that the Government are trying to solve the problems we face online, there is also the law of unintended consequences.</p>
<h2>The iPad Will Be Reinvented</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ipad2021.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>In 2020 Apple really pushed the boundaries of what we can expect from a laptop in terms of performance. All of a sudden we have laptops with 20-hour battery life that are faster than even most high-end Intel laptops. At the same time, Apple neglected to significantly update the iPad line in 2020, with only slightly faster processes and new colours coming to the midrange, and a LIDAR sensor being added to the top of the line iPad Pro. This leaves the iPad in a weird position - unless you need the Apple Pencil for drawing - there is no longer big productivity draw. It used to be an iPad with a keyboard dock and could get you a fast, ultraportable laptop-like device with amazing battery life. Part of my disappointment with the iPad over the past 10 years is that what stated out as the <em>next thing</em> in computing has really gone nowhere - it's simply evolved to become a laptop with a touchscreen. Now that actual laptops have many of the same benefits of the iPad but without the draconian App Store restrictions, where does this leave the iPad? As a sofa-based content consumption device it makes sense, but people aren't buying £770 tablets for Facebook and Netflix. Apple must surely see this, and so I am expecting something at the high end that is a hybrid of a Mac and an iPad. Something with the elegance and convenience of an iPad, but with the power of a proper laptop.</p>
<h2>GPT-3 Style Language Models Will Challenge the Media</h2>
<p>I have only had access to GPT-3 for a few weeks, but already I am amazed by it. The biggest surprise to me was that you don't need to train it with much of your own data, you simply <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/experimenting-with-gpt-3-felt-like-witnessing-a-technological-revolution-eb69bece747">give it a prompt</a> such as &quot;<em>Summarise the following text for a 10 year old</em>&quot; or provide it with a list, and it will continue the list. There are many exciting and positive applications of this technology, but while Open AI, the company behind GPT-3 is being ultra-responsible by only allowing access via an API key (that can be shut off in the case of misuse), and is providing developers with an avenue to report potentially dangerous output, it is only a matter of time before someone else who is not as conscientious will invent something similar to GPT-3. This could exacerbate problems we already see in online media at the moment. Already the web is full of numerous &quot;news sites&quot; that purport to be providing journalism, but are in fact thinly vailed opinion pieces short on facts. If these sites could instead churn out content with the click of a button, it will make the problem of fake news even worse. It will be up to our already struggling media sector to resist the temptation to join the race for our attention with clickbait headlines, and instead double-down on the reporting of objective truth. I expect questions about how such media is paid for, and who has access to it to become even more apparent in 2021. Paywalls for example are good idea in some respects, as they do not incentivise content written purely to capture more page views (ad impressions), but they also leave the majority outside of the paywall with the lower quality content. Thankfully in the UK we have the BBC, but even that is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack">under threat</a>. While I have faith that most will have the critical thinking skills not to be taken in by fake news (AI generated or not), we have seen in recent years that it can be very easy to be fooled - especially when it's something you're inclined to agree with anyway.</p>
<p>Those are just a few topics I think many of us will give thought to in 2021. Depending on how the pandemic plays out, I'm sure there will be many, many others too. With vaccine rollouts underway, let's hope we can get back to some sense of normality soon. What do you think 2021 will bring? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>End of Year Housekeeping</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/30/end-of-year-housekeeping/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:33:43 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/30/end-of-year-housekeeping/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A quick and boring housekeeping update:</p>
<p>I've changed the domain of this site to be <em><strong>imarc.co.uk</strong></em>. I had originally gone with <em>imarc.me</em> when I started the site earlier this year, but over the summer I jotted down all the domains I own, their annual cost and divided that figure by 12 and realised I was spending more than I wanted to on domain names. I've had the <em>.co.uk</em> domain since 2002 and don't plan on relinquishing it anytime soon, so I figured why not use it? Additionally, the old-school internet user in me still can't help thinking that any domain not ending in .com, .net, .org or a country TLD isn't a real domain (Readers who know their Internet history will know that <em>.me</em> stands for Montenegro, and is actually not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">generic TLD</a>, but it gets used like one). <strong><em>imarc.co.uk</em></strong> been home to many of my home pages before, including my own CMS at one point. Now it's home to this blog. The old <em>.me</em> domain will eventually expire and be bought by a domain squatter, so please update your bookmarks/RSS reader. Ultimately, it's unlikely <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/20/whats-in-a-domain/">anyone will notice</a> as content is what really matters, but in my mind, the small things matter too.</p>
<p>Secondly, I'm retiring my old personal blog <strong><em>Lost in Logic</em></strong>. The purpose the site you are reading now was to start afresh and only post content I believe adds something to the nonstop deluge of technology commentary we find online everyday, whereas my older blog was holiday photos intermixed with album reviews with the odd gadget review thrown in. It wasn't very focused. Moving it between various web hosts over the course of 10 years also took its toll - many of the images are broken in older posts. That said, it's still fun to be able to look back so I will keep the site online at this new URL: <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk">https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk</a> (I have migrated a few recent posts over to iMarc as I think they fit its theme). Some of my favourite posts were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2013/09/12/my-history-in-phones/">My history in mobile phones (2000 - 2012)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2014/07/13/iphone-os-3/index.html">How basic was iOS 3?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2014/02/16/some-photos-from-my-recent-trip-to-orlando-florida/index.html">Florida from the sky</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2011/11/06/10-years-of-the-ipod/index.html">10 years of the iPod</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading to the end - wishing you all the best for 2021!</p>

      <title>Is Chrome Bad?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/28/is-chrome-bad/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 19:07:02 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/28/is-chrome-bad/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter#Pull-to-Refresh">Loren Brichter</a>, <a href="https://chromeisbad.com">Chrome is bad</a>. He's been having some slowdowns on his Mac, and removing Chrome along with its associated update process called KeyStone seemed to fix the slowness issues. Other people have <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffreymfoster/status/1340383606536089605">concurred</a>, while others have understandably demanded some evidence, comparing it to the myth <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-force-closing-apps-makes-your-iphone-faster-of-macs/">that closing apps on an iPhone speeds it up</a>. (As an aside, when I was an iOS developer, I remember watching the iOS 'free memory' count go up when I swiped away an app. I also remember that Safari would release rendered pages from memory when system memory was low, meaning it would have to load and render the pages again as you switched between tabs. Other apps would likely release resources in response to 'low memory' broadcasts from the operating system too. Therefore in years past, there is no question that closing apps would at least speed up some aspects of your phone. Whether the practice is still a net-gain in 2020 when our devices have a lot more RAM is less certain, and will depend on your usage patterns.)</p>
<p>So is Chrome bad? My take is yes, probably, but not because of it's auto-updater. The system slowness issue doesn't appear to effect everyone, and may be an unintentional bug by either Google or Apple. Chrome is of course funded by advertising and so is likely using your browsing data in ways you might find creepy. With <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/23/microsoft-edge-is-finally-very-good/">Microsoft Edge now being based on Chromium</a>, I'm not sure why anyone would use Chrome in 2020. Edge supports the same plugins, renders pages the same and includes lots of easy-to-find privacy enhancing settings that are burried in Chrome, and no it doesn't use KeyStone to manage its updates. If you haven't already, I urge you to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">give Edge a try</a>.</p>

      <title>AirPods Pro Battery Degradation Over a Year</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/28/airpods-pro-battery-degradation-over-a-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 18:16:17 GMT</pubDate>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img_7653.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p><em>The right airport is a year old, the left one a few weeks.</em></p>
<p>I've had my AirPods Pro just shy of one year now. The left AirPod however was <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/03/airpods-rapid-warranty-replacement/">replaced</a> a few weeks ago. I used them today for a couple of hours and noticed for the first time how much faster the battery drained on the older AirPod. 13%! What a difference a year makes. There could be other explanations of course, battery conditioning being the main one. (It is a common belief that our electronics are able to gauge how much battery power is remaining, however they cannot; they are only able to estimate how much power has been used and subtract that from the last known total capacity of the battery.) Additionally, we've only had the luxury of <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/23/airpods-now-less-disposable/">smart charging</a> since September. The degradation won't be as pronounced for people buying new AirPods today.</p>

      <title>The Smaller Joys of 2020</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/27/the-smaller-joys-of-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 15:44:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/27/the-smaller-joys-of-2020/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It would be an understatement to say that 2020 has been a strange year. With much of the world in and out of lockdowns, something none of us with have though conceivable only months prior, it has been a watershed moment in many ways. While the news has been consistently awful as we've been stuck inside I have taken to appreciating the value of smaller joys of inner life: music, books and podcasts and coding.</p>
<h2>Album: <a href="https://songwhip.com/jamesdeanbradfield/even-in-exile">Even in Exile</a></h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/even-in-exile-1.jpg?w=300" alt="The album cover for &quot;Even in Exile&quot; by James Dean Bradfield."></p>
<p>At this stage in his career, you could be forgiven for being tempted to pass on a solo album by James Dean Bradfield. It's only the second such album from the Manic Street Preachers singer, but even after all this time it's perhaps one of the best of his career, including his Manics work. He's stated in interviews that being a solo album he didn't have the pressure to write a hit single, and so could just go where his mind took him and indulge a wide range of influences. This is a formula that has worked in the past (their first number one single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Tolerate_This_Your_Children_Will_Be_Next"><em>If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next</em></a> was originally planned as a b-side) but yet so much of the latter Manics career seems to be trying too hard. By seemingly not trying, he has made a masterpiece. The album is fantastic, full of fresh and heavily prog influenced melodies. Inspired by Chilean activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ADctor_Jara">Víctor Jara</a> the lyrics penned by Patrick Jones are also beautiful and perfectly match the mood of the music.</p>
<h2>Book: <a href="https://hughhowey.com/books/wool/">WOOL</a></h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wool.jpg?w=192" alt="Cover of the book &quot;WOOL&quot;"></p>
<p>It was released in 2011, but I only got round to reading it this year. It tells the story of a community who live underground a giant silo, in what appears to be a world where the air outside is poisonous. The silo is big enough support most human needs with farms, schools, its own police department and even a mayor. As the story unfolds, we the reader come to doubt the story that inhabitants have been told over the centuries. What really resonated with me while reading this during lockdown was the claustrophobic feeling of being trapped inside for fear of what you might breath in if you step outside. While the situation in 2020 isn't anywhere near as bad as the events in WOOL, as I read it I couldn't help feel that I couldn't have timed it better. The sequels are also pretty good too, so worth picking up.</p>
<h2>Podcast: <a href="https://doyouloveus.buzzsprout.com">Do You Love Us?</a></h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-you-love-us.jpg?w=300" alt="Podcast artwork for &quot;Do You Love Us?&quot;"></p>
<p>Manic Street Preachers are one of my favourite bands. So when this little podcast started in January seemingly out of nowhere I was pretty excited. Far from being a love in, the band are approached from the point of view of two non-fans and one mega fan. They then proceed to critically cover the entire Manic Street Preachers discography. Perfect for anyone looking to get into one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmPpTbWMRAE">best bands ever</a>.</p>
<h2>Gadget: <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a></h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/raspberry-pi.jpg?w=300" alt="Raspberry Pi"></p>
<p>Being a Mac/iPhone user has its benefits, everything <em>mostly</em> just works - but it's not very interesting. Early in in lockdown I ordered myself the latest Raspberry Pi, a £35 ARM computer. After adding a case, fan, HDMI cable and memory card, it was closer to £100 - but still not that expensive all things considered. Within days, I rekindled my love of messing about with computers. I gained a newfound respect for Linux, the <em>free</em> operating system that can do literally anything. I was amazed how much I remembered from my days as a developer. I soon had an AirPlay server up and running allowing me to beam music from my iPhone to my Sonos without having to bother with the frustrating Sonos app. I had an old portable hard drive and SMB network share acting as a NAS drive, PiHole blocking adverts across my entire network, and WireGuard acting as VPN so I can get the benefits of PiHole and access my files when I'm out of the house (not that I was leaving the house much during lockdown). I then moved on to playing about with <a href="http://www.mwic.co.uk/">nodeJS and Apache</a>. For a while I'd been looking to learn a new server side technology, having been a .NET/C# developer many years ago, and so an open source stack that runs on a £35 computer was perfect. I can't stress how cool it is to be able to take an idea, and a few hours later have something working. If coding is not your thing but games are, try <a href="https://retropie.org.uk">RetroPie</a>.</p>
<p>So that was my lockdown entertainment. What was yours?</p>

<p>Christmas in 2020 will obviously be very different for many people, but like many people at Christmas I find myself looking back to my childhood, as let's be honest, that's when Christmas is at it's best isn't it?</p>
<p>On the topic of looking back, here are two fantastic articles from The Register that are by no means new, but worth a read or reread if you find yourself with some spare time over the lull between Christmas and New Year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/12/18/search_engines_we_have_known/">Search engines we have known ... before Google crushed them</a> - charts the history and demise of the early search engines. AltaVista, Lycos, Excite, GoTo, all the names you may remember from Christmas past.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/11/28/the_bbc_news_online_story/">The inside story of the news website that saved the BBC</a> - A detailed look at how BBC News Online started. Back then nobody even knew what a news website should look like or how people would use it. They really were blazing the trail.</p>

      <title>What’s in a Domain?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/20/whats-in-a-domain/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 17:05:39 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/20/whats-in-a-domain/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I came across <a href="https://medium.com/@amd_2793/my-million-dollar-domain-hobby-c74b14db4e64">this fascinating blog post</a> about how one man and a few Ruby scripts managed to register what he estimates amounts to $1,000,000 worth of domain names. Many of the examples he <a href="https://gurge.com/domains.html">registered</a> are single word domain names such as <em>cheese.ai</em> and <em>crowbar.io</em>.</p>
<p>This set me wondering whether domain names <em>really</em> matter that much these days? Obviously some people see value in them, much like some people see value in a personalised number plate for their car (Something I have never understood - but each to their own.). A memorable domain name such <em>moonpig.com</em> or <em>comparethemarket.com</em> is genuinely useful for people looking to find you online, whereas a bespoke vehicle number plate is there to satisfy the owner. How many successful businesses use generic, one-word domain names anyway? For a while British Gas advertised their online presence as <em>www.house.co.uk</em>, but these days it redirects to <em>www.britishgas.co.uk</em>. Clearly trying to associate a well known brand with a tangentially related word didn't work out. The exception might be offering email services: <em>your.name@cheese.ai</em> would be pretty cool, and <em>hey.com</em> is an obvious recent example - but again I don't think many people are that bothered about their email address these days. For my job I have to review a lot of CVs, and I'm often surprised how many people who are clearly very qualified, have been in the industry for a while, yet have an email address with <em>gmail.com</em> or <em>hotmail.com</em>. When a domain costs around £10 a year, it seems like a no-brainer to have your own domain for professional reasons - yet most people don't.</p>
<p>So I've come to that conclusion that for most people domains do not matter. The web is now search-first. Gone are the days of meticulously typing <em>http://www.bbc.co.uk</em> into your web browser and smashing down with great satisfaction on the enter key; for most people, their browser either suggests the site or a Google search does instead. If domains don't matter, maybe I should start registering random strings instead? <em><strong>mimcxsxuqibozfq.com</strong></em> is it!</p>

      <title>“Do Not Disturb” as the Default</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/03/do-not-disturb-as-the-default/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ios_watchos_dnd.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>I'd really like to see mobile operating systems make less of a fuss when you have &quot;<em>Do Not Disturb</em>&quot; switched on. While the feature is a useful one, having a banner across the home screen, or an omnipresent icon at the top of the watch face only seeks to signify that not wanting to be disturbed is an exceptional state, not the norm. The default mode is &quot;<em>Disturb Me</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead, I wonder if the default should in fact be &quot;<em>Do Not Disturb</em>&quot; and that we should have to <em>choose</em> when we want notifications - with options to allow close friends and family to override the setting of course. If someone outside your close circle phones outside of your &quot;<em>Disturb Me</em>&quot; hours, Siri could take the call and inform them of when you'll be available.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/02/scientists-studying-why-gamers-invert-their-controls">reports on a new study</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is one of the most contentious aspects of video game playing – a debate where opposing sides literally cannot see each other’s perspective. When the Guardian ran an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls – meaning that they push their joypad’s thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen – the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am one of those people who cannot play a game without inverting the Y axis. I struggled with early 2000's classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeSplitters_2">TimeSplitters 2</a> because back then there was no systemwide setting to change the preference on PlayStation 2 (though I think the original Xbox had one). Why do I have such a preference? I can only think it's because I used to play a lot of flight simulators, but will keenly await the results of the study.</p>

      <title>AirPods Rapid Warranty Replacement</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/03/airpods-rapid-warranty-replacement/</link>

      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/03/airpods-rapid-warranty-replacement/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/left_airpods_pro.jpg?w=300" alt=""></p>
<p>Kudos to Apple for getting a replacement AirPod Pro out to me within three days of me reporting the fault. Without any notice, a single AirPod arrived at my door in this cute little box. My <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/03/05/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> had developed the <a href="https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues">known fault</a> where one of them (in my case the left one) starts to make a rattling/cracking sound with movement. You can hear it when walking fast, and it's downright horrible when running. I'd also noticed the noice cancellation becoming less efficient, though it was very subtle, I recall having to have the sound much louder in order to hear over traffic.</p>
<p>One tip, if you do get one AirPod replaced then you need to make it pair with your case and the remaining AirPod. To do this, I found I had to unpair the case from my phone, leave the AirPods in the case for a couple of hours <strong>while charging</strong>, and then go through the usual paring process. if I tried to pair before leaving them for a few hours, they just got stuck with a flashing amber light.</p>
<p>So great service from Apple, but I wish they'd just offered to replace both earbuds. It seems likely at some point in the future my right AirPod Pro is going to have the same issue, but for now they are back in business and Apple's 2-year warranty programme will take me through to January 2022.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>After not switching on my Xbox One for a few months, it wouldn't connected to my WiFi. It kept saying &quot;Can't connect to DHCP Server&quot;. Rebooting the router, and forgetting the WiFi network made no difference. In the end, the way to fix it was to <strong>go into my router's network settings, look for the list of devices that had previous connected (and been assigned an IP address), and remove the Xbox from the list. Within minutes, my Xbox was back on the Internet, and downloading updates.</strong></p>

      <title>Salesforce Buys Slack</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">$27.7 billion</a>, or <a href="https://theoverspill.wordpress.com/salesforce-slack-acquisition-start-up-1442#dd20c1ac23517f956ec06ea28296243d">$250,000 per paying user</a>. It's a testament to good product management that Slack has maintained is simplicity in the face of competition from Microsoft Teams. In my experience, Slack's simple emulation of traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> encourages real-time collaboration that is great at the time, but not easy to refer back to after the fact. Microsoft Teams on the other hand presents users with the option of adding a subject line to messages, meaning it gets treated more like email, with threads and replies that can be impossible to follow in real-time. This does however make it easier to find what was said later on.</p>
<p>I don't use CRM Systems on a daily basis, but I have had to work on products that integrate with them. Salesforce is far easier to use and develop for than Microsoft Dynamics, so I think this deal could bode well for Slack users.</p>

<p>It's crazy to see the British tabloids egging people on in trying and find loopholes in the UK Government's Coronavirus restrictions. A better headline would have been &quot;<em>Ignore lightweight Agriculture Minister George Eustice, and keep to the spirit of the rules</em>. <em>Viruses don't care about your intent, technicalities, or what the Government says</em>&quot;. Then again, there's a reason why I didn't go into journalism.</p>

      <title>Leave Productivity to Economists</title>

      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/11/26/leave-productivity-to-economists/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Lots of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsofts-productivity-score-tool-invades-employee-privacy-2020-11?r=US&amp;IR=T">headlines today</a> about a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/productivity/productivity-score?view=o365-worldwide">feature</a> called <em><strong>Productivity Score</strong></em> that is part of Microsoft Office 365. The service promises to help &quot;<em>organizations transform how work gets done with insights about how people use Microsoft 365 and the technology experiences that support them.</em>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-productivity-score-1.png?w=700" alt=""></p>
<p>While on the face of it, <em>Productivity Score</em> does sound somewhat Orwellian, I think this is down to poor naming. What it really seems to be is a measure of how people use various Microsoft products. If it helps companies measure their ROI on Office 365 and respects privacy, then so be it. While it's possible some gullible manager somewhere might equate software usage to productivity, I have faith that in most organisations this will not be the prevailing view. Productivity is all about efficiency of work produced, and is something that evening leading economists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_paradox">struggle to grapple with</a>. Anyone who has spent more than 10 minutes in a modern workplace will tell you that simply having conference calls and creating Powerpoint presentations does not equate to being productive. Calls, emails, spreadsheets and whatever else <em>Productivity Score</em> measures are byproducts of productivity, not evidence of it.</p>

      <title>Is That Recommended Song an Advertisement?</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In what seems to been an inevitable move in the march of awfulness that is much of the tech industry these days, Spotify has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/">announced</a> that it will be giving artists who pay for the privilege a boost in the algorithm that recommends music to its customers.</p>
<p>For many, especially those who listen to commercial radio, this is probably nothing new. The idea of a record label paying to get their acts in front of more listeners is a pretty standard affair. However, the idea these ads might be sold to customers as a personalised recommendations seems creepy to me. I hope they are clearly labelled as ads, even if the artist having paid for promotion is only one of many inputs into the algorithm that ultimately produces the recommendation.</p>
<p>I never really got on with Spotify's user interface, but I do use Apple Music due to its Siri and Apple Watch integration. The recommendations seem to be very US centric and can be very hit and miss. I've found a couple of new artists via Apple Music, but mostly I find most of my new music via <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_6music">6 Music</a>. I can't see Apple selling out like this.</p>

      <title>Should Homeworkers Be Taxed for the Privilege?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/11/14/should-homeworkers-be-taxed-for-the-privilege/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2020 16:10:31 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/11/14/should-homeworkers-be-taxed-for-the-privilege/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/11/staff-who-work-from-home-after-pandemic-should-pay-more-tax">The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Employees who continue working from home after the pandemic should be taxed for the privilege, with the proceeds used to help lower-paid workers, according to a new report. Economists at Deutsche Bank have proposed making staff pay a 5% tax for each day they choose to work remotely. They argue it would leave the average employee no worse off because of savings made by not commuting and not buying lunch on-the-go and fewer purchases of work clothing. Alternatively, the report suggests the tax could be paid by employers who do not provide their workforce with a permanent desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I agree that there is a desperate need to rebalance the economy and ensure that essential workers who often cannot work from home are compensated in such a way that recognises how utterly essential their work actually is, it does seem somewhat shortsighted to me that you would penalise people for being productive at home while also being kinder to the planet and not commuting. For one, buying fewer clothes is a good thing for the planet, though I think most people will find other excuses to buy new clothes.</p>
<p>Many office workers do not buy expensive takeaway food every day as the article suggests. Anecdotally, when we were at the office, I noticed a lot of my colleagues used to simply bring in last night's leftovers in for lunch. Those that do buy lunch every day will likely drive demand in local shops and cafes. Even in lockdown, my local village bakery frequently has people queuing out of the door at lunchtime. All of this is to say that such for some, such a tax could make it more expensive to work from home, especially those who drive to work rather than take more expensive public transport. Do we really want people driving to the office just to save money? Let's hope governments skip past this one, as there are plenty of other ways to increase tax revenue.</p>

      <title>Should We Give Up Trying to Estimate How Long It Takes to Write Software?</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a <a href="https://medium.com/computers-are-hard/computers-are-hard-building-software-with-david-heinemeier-hansson-c9025cdf225e">fascinating interview</a> with David Heinemeier Hansson, of recent <a href="https://imarc.me/2020/07/19/hey-dot-coms-attitude-is-a-refreshing-change/">Hey.com</a> fame. He makes the point that when building software, we shouldn't try to estimate features and then fit them into two week sprints. Instead, it should be possible to determine the value of solving a particular problem and then set time boundaries on solving it. The timeframes needn't be short two-week sprints as if often the case in scrum, but something more suited to solving the problem in hand, say 6 weeks.</p>
<p>His central theme is that software is more akin to creative projects like books or movies than big engineering projects like building a skyscraper. While I think there are some interesting ideas here, and as a practitioner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> I am also keenly aware of how easy it can be to become dogmatic about the various ceremonies and systems it advocates so much so that you end up becoming <em>less agile</em>.</p>
<p>That said I think shorter iterations are useful when you are unsure of the value of a certain feature. Building the smallest MVP allows you to test the market in order to determine the value. The idea of setting a time budget and giving the team a couple of months to build out a feature without the overhead and bureaucracy that Scrum entails does seem incising however, and may be appropriate in some cases. I will try to keep this in mind as I develop projects in the future.</p>

      <title>Keeping Up to Date With Twitter Without Using Twitter</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I try to avoid Twitter or other social media, I’ve come to see it as the equivalent of trashy daytime TV - bad for the mind, and there’s <em>always</em> something much better I could be doing with my time. For many months now I’ve not had any social network apps installed on my phone. I did find however that for Twitter specifically I missed seeing Tweets from a handful of individuals whose posts were more often than not links to intelligent and insightful articles.</p>
<p>To solve this, I’m using a feature of <a href="https://feedbin.me">Feedbin</a> - my RSS sync service of choice. Feedbin allows you to include Twitter accounts as part of your RSS feed. This means you don’t have to “follow” the account, you never see how many “likes” or “retweets” a post has, and you can easily read any linked articles alongside other RSS subscriptions. There are no advertisements, no “recommended for you” lists, and best of all, you can’t see any replies either. No snark, no “<a href="https://unherd.com/2020/01/cast-out-how-knitting-fell-into-a-purity-spiral/">purity spirals</a>”, no inclination to reply or retweet anything myself. I’ve found that being a passive onlooker instead of an active participant on Twitter drastically reduces its addictiveness.</p>

<p>This is why my Samsung TV is no longer connected to the Internet. Instead, I use an Apple TV to stream media.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/reduce-lound-sounds-ios-watchos.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>A reminder that you should make sure you have enabled the new '<strong>Reduce Loud Sounds</strong>' option in both iOS 14 and watchOS 7, which puts a safe limit on headphone volume.</p>
<p>These settings were previous managed in <a href="https://imarc.me/2020/05/22/the-little-things-headphone-audio-levels/">different places</a> within both operating systems and the limit I set in the previous version did not carry over when I upgraded. This is a bit of a worrying slip in QA from Apple, as it could quite easily lead to a potentially ear-damaging situation where someone happily sets their volume to maximum thinking they have a safe limit set, but they in fact do not.</p>
<p>I recommend setting the limit to to the lowest level, 75 dB. Your ears will no doubt have to contend with other shocks throughout the day, so don't go adding any unnecessary ones. You certainly don't want to end up with tinnitus like me!</p>
<p>The new setting can be found under <strong><em>Settings → Sounds &amp; Haptics</em></strong>.</p>
<p><em>Update: Apple have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211865">acknowledged</a> the bug described above.</em></p>

      <title>watchOS 7: After Five Years, The Apple Watch Is Hitting Its Stride, but at What Price?</title>

      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/27/watchos-7-after-five-years-the-apple-watch-is-hitting-its-stride-but-at-what-expense/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>It's hard to believe that the Apple Watch has been a product now for over five years. It still seems like yesterday that I drove home from the Apple Store with the fancy new gadget in my bag, excited to see what it could do. That was June 2015. Over the past five years the product has evolved so gradually that if you've been paying close attention to each release, it would be difficult to pin down what exactly changed and when. However, just like seeing an infant relative for the first time in months and noticing how much they've grown, if you were to compare the current generation Apple Watch and its latest operating system to the original, it's clear that the product released in 2015 and the product Apple sells today is vastly different.</p>
<p>When Apple announced the Apple Watch in 2014, it was billed as three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A highly accurate and customisable timepiece</li>
<li>An intimate communications device</li>
<li>A comprehensive health and fitness device.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/38IqQpwPe7s?t=5866"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/timcook-applewatch-2014.png?w=1024" alt=""></a></p>
<p>At the time I felt they were trying too hard to mimic Steve Job's famous introduction to the iPhone where he initially sold the audience on the fact he was introducing three products (A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough Internet communications device.) - but the joke was on them, it was of course a single device.</p>
<p>Whilst that framing helped consumers understand the iPhone, for the Apple Watch, it only seemed to add confusion. An accurate and customisable timepiece? Swatch watches are highly accurate and come in every possible combination of colours imaginable. Accurate? Some people pay thousands of pounds for <em>less accurate</em> mechanical watches. What does an <em>intimate communication device</em> even do that my phone can't already? Health and fitness however. Oh... now I get it.</p>
<p>As the years went on, the watch became more and more focused on fitness - with the addition of GPS and waterproofing, and health, with fall detection, irregular heart rhythm detection and now the ability to measure blood oxygen levels. The operating system has also evolved to become more focused. The ability to set pace alerts when running, and see your current speed when cycling were obvious features missing from the original release that are present now. What hasn't happened yet though, as many predicted, is the watch replacing our phones. While it can <em>technically</em> do the job of a smartphone: maps, directions, messaging, phone calls - the combination of a small screen and still terrible battery life mean it's still not a viable phone replacement for most people.</p>
<p>Now after five years of the Apple Watch, it's time for watchOS 7. I installed it the day after its release, eager to check out its new features</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Let's get the bad out of the way. Upon installing watchOS 7 my battery life became atrocious. On the second day, my battery was dead by 9PM, and that's having charged the watch fully at 1PM. In addition, the watch stopped being able to track workouts using GPS. It was if I'd disabled location services, but I hadn't.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/watch-os-7.jpg?w=300" alt=""></p>
<p>If you Google anything to do with Apple devices having poor battery life after an update you'll often find a common folktale that puts it down to &quot;Indexing&quot; - yes apparently after 13 years of software updates, Apple still runs a battery draining process to do &quot;<a href="https://www.imore.com/how-to-fix-apple-watch-battery-life-problems#wait">Indexing</a>&quot; after every update. This is most likely BS, as what is there to index on a watch anyway? After trying all of the obvious fixes, and with a watch that couldn't log workouts or last the day, I ended up wiping the watch and reinstalling watchOS. Thankfully, this seemed to solve both the issues and was now back in business.</p>
<h2>Sleep Tracking</h2>
<p>The headline feature of watchOS 7 is of course sleep tracking. I've tried various sleep tracking apps in the past, and I've never really found them that useful. I just find that I don't need an app to tell me whether or not I've had a good night's sleep - it's pretty obvious. Maybe I'm missing the point, but having to micromanage my device by charging it at the right time, and having to wear a chunky watch to bed seems like too much hassle for very little gain. Needless to say, I haven't tried the new sleep tracking features. The addition of sleep tracking does mean that the wakeup alarm is now shared between the phone and watch. The end result is my watch telling me its set to wake me up with a vibration alert, even though my phone is actually what goes off - presumably because I'm not wearing the watch during sleep. I like this feature, but it does add complexity. In fact, to even set a wake alarm I was pushed into a long wizard that had me setting up a 'sleep schedule' complete with reminders to charge the watch and other things. It all felt a bit too complicated and onerous for a part of my life that's supposed to be relaxing. It also smacks of <a href="https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/solutionism.html"><em>technocratic solutionism</em></a> - the idea that by defining a 'sleep schedule' on my phone, and with some pretty graphics and notifications, I will be on my way to a life of blissful nights of full and restful sleep. If anything, I imagine switching <em>off</em> my smartwatch and smartphone a few hours before bed would do a better job of helping me sleep than defining a 'sleep schedule' and monitoring my every move at night.</p>
<h2>Fitness</h2>
<p>The Activity app has been renamed Fitness. It's a subtle change, but reveals a lot about where the engineers at Apple see the device fitting into people's lives. The word 'Activity' implied passive measurement of one's movements, whereas the word 'Fitness' is full of aspiration to become better, stronger and fitter. Not everyone who buys an Apple Watch will be a fitness enthusiast, even if that is what Apple would have us believe in their advertisements which are full of good looking, trendy people who live in gyms. I wonder how this change will affect people who know they aren't fit, or who perhaps struggle with physical exercise. For a company that strives for inclusiveness, I do worry whether Apple can be a bit self indulgent sometimes, designing products that are perhaps a bit too focused on rich Silicon Valley 20-somethings, and not the population in general (except when those outsiders fit into neat boxes, e.g. old people who are likely to fall over). Perhaps that's unfair, but it's a concern I have all the same.</p>
<p>The new Fitness app finally lets you change the fitness goals for exercise and stand (the green and blue rings), but stops short of letting you choose different goals for different days of the week. While I love the gamification of meeting my active calorie target, I find that on days when I run 10 miles I tend to nearly triple my target, while on days when I am purposely resting, I struggle to meet 75% of my target (Even a 30 minute walk won't get me close). In the end, I choose a target that I know is beatable most days with a bit of effort - but I'd much prefer to set either a weekly target, or to be able to designate certain days as 'rest days' - something that factors in the realities of real life fitness training. Despite what the Fitness app may recommend, you can't just keep burning more and more calories each day without also taking rest days and eating the right foods. A more holistic approach to fitness would be welcomed here. The new Fitness app also integrates with the new apple Fitness+ service. The geek in my thinks this is super cool, the fact that my heart rate will be shown on the Apple TV, while the watch triggers haptic feedback that is synchronised to events in the workout video is frankly genius. However, the cynic is me also thinks that $9.99/month for what are essentially pre-recorded fitness videos is an awful lot when compared to a service like Netflix. I will definitely try it when it comes to the UK, but I'm doubtful whether I'll keep it beyond the free trial.</p>
<h2>Family Setup</h2>
<p>The other big feature of watchOS 7 is the ability to setup watches that are paired to an iPhone, but can be used by another member of the family who doesn't own that phone - for example children too young to haven an iPhone. I don't have children, but I think this is an exciting step towards the Apple Watch not requiring a phone at all. Tellingly, when setup in 'child mode' the watch does not try to get children to work towards a calorie burn goal, instead they are given a 'move time' goal. Whether this is due to limitations in the calorie-burn algorithms or whether Apple thinks it would be bad for the mental health of children to be even thinking about how many calories they are burning I am not sure, I'm hoping its the latter.</p>
<p>Whether anyone would actually buy their kids an Apple Watch remains to be seen - <em>if the child is old enough to wear a watch that costs nearly £300, then surely they must be old enough for a phone</em> - but if it helps Apple learn how to make an Apple Watch that could work for Android users or without an iPhone, then that can only be a good thing.</p>
<h2>Watch Faces</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/watchface2.jpg?w=300" alt=""></p>
<p>In watchOS 6, Apple finally decided to add some decent analogue watch faces. Before watchOS 6, almost none of the analogue faces had numerals, which coupled with the weirdness of having a circular face on a rectangular screen, made it frustratingly difficult to tell the time. In watchOS 7 Apple have added even more watch faces with <em>actual numerals</em> - three of which are essentially the same face with their own individual built in functionality: GMT lets you track the time in another timezone, Count Up has a built in stopwatch that is shown inline, as does Chronograph Pro - though the data is shown in the style of a traditional chronograph. Interestingly, these built-in applications keep running when you switch watch face and maintain their own state, unlike the original chronograph face from 2015, which simple displays data from the built-in in stopwatch app.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/siriwatchace.jpeg?w=175" alt=""></p>
<p>Disappointingly there is no update to the Siri watch face. It still looks like it was designed for the older 38/42mm size watches (Series 3 and before). In iOS 14, Apple gave us home screen widgets and the ability to create a <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/create-a-widget-stack/">smart stack</a></em> - a single slot that can be set to show any number of widgets. The system will determine the appropriate widget to show based on your usage and the other data. Ever <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2015/08/23/making-the-apple-watch-more-glancable/index.html">since 2015</a> I have wanted this feature on the Apple Watch. It should show me <em>the weather</em> when its about to rain, my cellular signal when the watch is using cellular, the time remaining on a timer when a timer is running, my battery level when its getting low etc.</p>
<p>Until this happens, the Siri face is the closest you can get to this kind of 'smart complication', but I don't use it because it's frankly ugly and not very customisable. Apple really needs to give it some attention, or if not, build in a 'smart stack' like system for complications and let any watch face be smart.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The other exciting feature of watchOS 7 is <em>optimised battery charging</em> - this feature means that the watch learns your typical usage patterns, and once placed on the charger for the night, will only charge to 80%. It then waits before charging up to 100% based on when you are expected to start using it again. This means less time with the battery kept at 100%, which means overall greater longevity for the battery. The system is linked to your location and wakeup alarm, so if you're travelling or have an early start it will default to charging straight to 100%. (It's also <a href="https://imarc.me/2020/06/23/airpods-now-less-disposable/">coming to AirPods soon</a>, where due to their even smaller batteries, it is desperately needed).</p>
<p>Force Touch has been removed completely - this is mostly a good thing as it wasn't a very good idea in hindsight, but it's a shame they don't allow watches that still have the hardware use it as a shortcut for pressing and holding - entering the mode to edit watch faces seems a lot slower now and I've even triggered it accidentally, which never happened before. Talking of speed, there are no issues on my two year old Series 4. In fact, Apple seems to have made a point of speeding the animations so everything feels much faster.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/watch-maps-1.png?w=269" alt=""></p>
<p>Many of the built in apps seem more polished. Maps for example now shows both directions and the map at the same time which makes using the watch for walking directions much more intuitive. The Remote app seems more reliable, and the Podcasts app seems to do a better job of syncing between the watch and phone. I can't say whether this is the result of watchOS 7 or the consequence of wiping and reinstalling watchOS - but I'm happy either way.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>Overall watchOS 7 is a solid release - it's faster on the same hardware, and brings with it some much desired new features. If I were Apple, I would be keeping my eye on the additional complexity that is creeping into watchOS. What made the Apple Watch such a joy to use in 2015 was in part its limitations. I understand the juxtaposition Apple is in - they have to be seen be moving the platform forward - but in an age where people are addicted to their smartphones more than ever, the Apple Watch's sweet spot is being able to help you lead a <em>healthier</em> life by monitoring your activity and vitals, while also helping you lead a <em>happier</em> life by being simple and less addictive than a smartphone. How Apple strikes the balance going forward will be vital to its success.</p>
<p>Update: Apple have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201023220556/https://support.apple.com/en-sa/HT211865">acknowledged</a> the bugs described above.</p>

      <title>Eight Years of Home Screen Curation Gone Thanks to iOS 14</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For the past few years I have decided to play it safe and wait for a couple of months for new iOS releases to settle in before updating. This year however, I decided to live on the wild side and upgraded on release day.</p>
<p>Well, I paid the price for installing what is essentially beta software on my phone. Somehow when arranging home screen widgets, the springboard application managed to loose all knowledge of the folders I had created, and the applications I had placed into them - a system I had been building up and had carried over from my iPhone 5 when I switched back from Android in 2012.</p>
<p>I happened to be screen recoding at the time. In the video below, keep an eye on the number of home screens (the dots at the bottom) - watch them change from three to fifteen as all of my carefully curated folders are lost.</p>
<p>I could have restored my device from a backup, I didn't like the thought of having to reauthorise all my Apple Pay cards and wait for hours while my phone sat there restoring (I'd also loose a day's worth of messages and photos). In the end, I've decided to fully embrace iOS 14's new App Library system, placing a few frequently used apps on the home screen and letting the system sort the other apps into folders for me.</p>
<p>Bugs happen, and while this is technically a data loss bug, the data isn't <em>that</em> critical. The world's most valuable company, with all its piles of cash, releasing its software in such a poor state has just served to reenforce the fact that when it comes to software (and possibly products in general), money alone cannot buy success. People and processes are what make successful software. In Apple's case, I suspect the release date was decided not by engineers, but by the marketing division.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_7115.png" alt=""> If you own an Apple Watch, I highly recommend turning off the &quot;<em>Notifications Indicator</em>&quot; - the red dot at the top of the screen that indicates something is waiting for your attention. For me, it was an itch I just had to scratch. With it turned off, I am less likely to be distracted when simply checking the time, and therefore more in the moment, and far less stressed. This recommendation of course goes along with the most important piece of advice for Apple Watch users: turn off notifications on the watch for every app except the ones you <em>really</em> care about. For me, this means I mainly have messaging, fitness and authenticator apps going to the watch. Games, Netflix, social networks, and especially news alerts are diverted to my phone (in fact I might just turn off news alerts altogether!). The notifications indicator can be turned off from the Apple Watch app on your iPhone under &quot;Clock Settings&quot;.</p>

      <title>The Beats Solo Pro Have a Wind Problem</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/07/the-beats-solo-pro-have-a-wind-problem/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_6386.jpeg?w=640" alt=""></p>
<p>Back at the end of February I decided I needed to get a pair of over the ear headphones for the office. (Little did I know I'd have only about another 3 weeks left in the office until my recent return at the end of August.)</p>
<p>I originally had my sights (sounds?) set on the Sony WH-1000XM3. These are often considered best noise cancelling headphones on the market - and noise cancellation is what I was after. Office life can be full of interesting distractions, but nothing beats putting on some Radiohead and getting lost in your work for a couple of hours. My AirPods were great, but over-the-ear headphones are even better for really blocking the outside world and being able to focus.</p>
<p>Moments before hitting the trigger on the buy button, I remembered that Apple owns Beats, and that means that newer Beats headphones have the same H1 chip founds in the <a href="https://imarc.me/2020/03/05/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> - this in turn means seamless pairing with all the Apple devices I own, the ability for new messages to be read out automatically, and handsfree use of 'Hey Siri'. At the last moment, I changed my mind and went for the Beats Solo Pro instead. At the same price, most reviews has reassured me that the sound was actually pretty decent, unlike previous generations of Beats (which I ended up returning because of this).</p>
<p>First impressions were great. The sound is indeed very good - not as good as the AirPods Pro, but still extremely enjoyable and seemingly optimised more for music than for podcasts or phone calls. Comfort-wise, they can be a bit hot and because unlike the Sony WH-1000XM3 they are <em>on ear</em> not <em>over ear</em>, but are fine for wearing for a couple of hours at a time, but certainly not all day.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Until I took them outside during my government mandated daily lockdown exercise. It turns out that both transparency and noise cancellation modes are pretty much unusable outside due to the fact that even the smallest, most minor breeze will be picked up by the onboard microphone and amplified right into your ears. Imagine someone blowing into a microphone and that's what it sounds like. While this obviously won't be a problem in the office, I can imagine a lot of people buying these for use outside - and they will likely be disappointed.</p>
<p>So while the H1 chip and integration with all of my Apple devices is excellent, the sound really punches, they look decent and are OK-ish on the comfort side - this one issue makes me wish I'd gone for the Sonys instead.</p>
<p>This a just a brief review to highlight the issue of wind effecting the Beats Solo Pro. For a more rounded review, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVWfTipUrAs">this YouTube video</a>.</p>
<h2>Update: August 2023</h2>
<p>After nearly three years (1,051 days to be exact) the headband snapped, and the Beats went in the bin. A few months later I replaced them with the Sony WH-1000XM5s. The sound quality is remarkably better and make the beats sound awful with the benefit of hindsight.</p>

      <title>Going Back to the Office for the Right Reasons</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/06/going-back-to-the-office-for-the-right-reasons/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/06/going-back-to-the-office-for-the-right-reasons/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_7090.jpg?w=300" alt=""></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/28/media-blitz-to-get-workers-back-to-offices-amid-pandemic">strange move for a Conservative government</a>, it was announced recently that workers will actively be encouraged to return to the office in order to help businesses such as coffee shops, who rely on the custom of office workers. I use the word ‘strange’ because asking the population to behave in a certain way in order to support part of the economy seems like the beginning of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy">planned economy</a> – the antithesis of free market conservatism - proving it's not the panacea they often claim. In addition, many local independent shops have actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/30/independent-shops-enjoy-business-boost-due-to-commuting-drop">enjoyed a boost</a> due to people staying at home in places that would usually be deserted during the day.</p>
<p>I recently broke my streak of 115 days of home working and returned to the office for the first time since March. I eagerly anticipated not having to use Microsoft Teams video calls and seeing my colleagues for the first time in person. No more would I have to endure delay, frozen screens, and overhearing partners taking meetings with their own colleagues. I was granted the pleasure of instant conversation without the awkward fumbling of headsets and the repeated ‘Can you hear me now?’ punctuating every call. I thoroughly enjoyed casual chat and felt my wellbeing improve instantly. With a limited number of people allowed in the office, it felt different to the warm buzz that would usually emanate beneath rows of monitors, but it was still hugely valuable.</p>
<p>Working from home has it benefits too. The lack of a long commute meant more exercise, extra pocket money and less road rage. I was able to focus more on completing tasks and I no longer had the regular 10 minute coffee and chat break in the kitchen. You could argue that in knowledge work, taking your mind off the task at hand can actually <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23431260-200-how-to-daydream-your-way-to-better-learning-and-concentration/#bx312602B3">reap massive rewards</a>, so maybe having a balance between the productivity of home work and the creative head space of office work is probably the way forward.</p>
<p>Whilst for many the future of work will be remote, I believe there will always be a need for a common shared office space. Whether it be a the <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_do_we_feel_awe">feeling of awe</a> we get when entering a well designed, bustling office, the motivational speech given by a company leader, the wearing of corporate ID lanyards, or just having lunch with colleagues – these are quasi-religious behaviours that are deep-seated in human history and enforce a sense of ‘togetherness’ that is essential for productive teamwork. That said, some peace and quiet is also important – so my ideal split would be something like 3 days a week at home, and 2 days in the office.</p>
<p>Maybe the government doesn’t need to encourage the complete return to office work quite so earnestly. Maybe those that can remotely work should be given a choice to find the balance that works best for them.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Owen Williams writes on OneZero: <em><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/apples-latest-power-move-steals-web-traffic-from-publishers-6c7469c8a38b">Apple’s Latest Power Move Steals Web Traffic From Publishers</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A change discovered in iOS 14 and macOS 11 betas this week suggests that Apple is hoping to quietly hijack and redirect users into its paid Apple News+ service</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From various comments I’ve heard of Apple News+, one of the most frustrating aspects of the service is that even after subscribing, when you click a link on the web that’s behind a paywall, but is from a publisher you have access to as part of your Apple News+ subscription, you are still locked out from reading it. The only way to read the article that you’ve paid to access is to search for it within the Apple News app. I’m pretty sure Apple are simply addressing this flaw in the design and common user complaint. If you don’t pay for Apple News, and haven’t started a free trial, this won’t effect you.</p>
<p>So no grand plan, no ‘power move’, and certainly no attempt to ‘hijack’.</p>
<p>That said, I think iOS should have an option to stop <em>all</em> web (http) links launching apps altogether - not just Apple News. I’ve uninstalled apps such as The Guardian because I was fed up of web links opening in the app. Apple already has an elegant way to show you that an app you have installed can be used instead of the web - “Smart App Banners”. One extra tap isn’t really a big deal and would’ve caused less uproar in the case of Apple News+.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaabqaaaanscayaaacwk56aaabg2ldq1bzukdcielfqzyxoty2ltiu-2.jpg?w=300" alt="iOS Smart App Banner"></p>
<p>Smart App Banners prompt users to install or open a website’s app, and once the app is launched, users are shown the same context within the app.</p>

      <title>Xbox Game Pass: Is the Future of Software Streamed?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/08/08/streaming-software-xbox-game-pass/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 08:16:03 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/08/08/streaming-software-xbox-game-pass/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another news story about Apple's App Store policies. This time, it is Microsoft <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-calls-out-apple-xbox-game-pass-roadblock-2020-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">complaining</a> about the fact Apple's rules mean Xbox Game Pass cannot be made be available on the iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>While I can see the argument that Xbox Game Pass is simply <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/netflix-and-xbox-game-pass/">Netflix for games</a>, as I see it, the key difference is that <em>games are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture#Instructions">software</a> and videos are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)">content</a></em>. If Apple allow software to be streamed in the store, could this, in theory, open the floodgates to other developers whose motivations might not be as sincere as Microsoft's?</p>
<p>Apple already has a struggle on its hands to encourage big application makers to build high quality, native applications for its platforms. Many apps that need a presence on both Android and iOS use some kind of intermediate framework that makes the app cheaper to develop, as there's only one codebase with minimal changes for each operating system. This usually comes at the expense of usability and inability to take advantage of platform specific features. You can usually tell when this is the case, as the resulting apps often won't feel quite right - if you're looking for an example, then maybe try your electricity company's app (for some reason, utility companies seem to be ripe for this kind of cheaply made app).</p>
<p>Imagine if instead of building a cross platform app using one of these frameworks, there was an <em>even cheaper option</em> - build an app that runs in the cloud. It's the ultimate option for companies that just need an app with the most minimal expenditure. The user experience would be terrible - but many companies don't care. Your £1,000+ iPhone would be acting as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client">thin client</a>.</p>
<p>So while I think streaming makes sense for games (I can't wait to play <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-set-for-launch-on-august-18-for-pc-also-with-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-beta/">Flight Simulator 2020</a> and streaming it over Xbox Game Pass might be the only way I can, due to its stringent hardware requirements) - I can kind of understand Apple's reluctance to allow software streaming, and making an exception for games seems kind of arbitrary. If Microsoft can stream games, why shouldn't Adobe be allowed to stream their Creative Cloud applications?</p>
<p>Will the future of software be in the cloud, a future where we all use low-specification <em>thin clients</em>? We're not there yet, and Apple's investment in low powered CPU and GPU technologies, coupled with the fact they make their money selling premium hardware, tells me that they see a future where our computing power is in our pockets, not the cloud.</p>

<p>So it seems <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-algorithm-charter-world-first">New Zealand is at it again</a> when it comes to leadership <a href="https://data.govt.nz/assets/data-ethics/algorithm/Algorithm-Charter-2020_Final-English-1.pdf"></a>on the world stage. The government has released an '<a href="https://data.govt.nz/assets/data-ethics/algorithm/Algorithm-Charter-2020_Final-English-1.pdf">algorithm charter</a>' that aims to tackle the lack of transparency and potential bias in automated systems.</p>
<p>This is a long time coming, and other countries need to pay attention.</p>
<p>Whilst the document is a great start, its language is somewhat vague and aspirational - perhaps intentionally so, given it is early days for this kind of scheme.</p>
<p>As AI and automated systems become evermore present in our daily lives, with the potential to <a href="https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/ai-artificial-intelligence-screening-resumes-how-to-prepare.html">decide your next job</a> or even the next <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055348/facebook-trump-election-2020-leaked-memo-bosworth">US president</a> - I don't think it's unreasonable to expect companies to be more transparent about how their AI works.</p>
<p>Just as we expect companies to file accounts and keep records, we should ask companies to answer a few basic questions about how their algorithms work. This will give consumers confidence that they're not subject to unfair bias when decisions that affect them are made by AI.</p>
<p>To make AI more transparent, I'd ask companies for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high level description of the type of algorithms in use - most machine learning algorithms are not written from scratch - so just tell us for example whether the algorithm is a Logistic Regression or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer Network</a> etc.</li>
<li>The source of the data used to train the model - did the company collect it themselves, if so, where from? Or did they buy it from a 3rd party, if so, who, and where did <em>they</em> get it from?</li>
<li>The features used to train the model - knowing for example that 'sex' or 'age' are fed into the model would tell us where to look for potential bias.</li>
<li>The methods, and datasets used to validate their model's effectiveness - this is critical - a company without a good validation strategy is obviously going to have unconscious bias in their systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've picked the questions carefully as I think companies have a right to maintain their trade secrets. The data itself can remain secret, as should the various parameters and other specifics about the algorithm.</p>
<p>While I'm not expecting the average consumer to understand the different between machine learning algorithms and the consequences of different testing strategies, having this information in the public domain would enable journalists and the tech community to better hold big tech companies to account.</p>

      <title>TikTok and 32 other iOS apps still snoop your sensitive clipboard data</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/">Dan Goodin for Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The privacy invasion is the result of the apps repeatedly reading any text that happens to reside in clipboards, which computers and other devices use to store data that has been cut or copied from things like password managers and email programs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love that Apple have started to notify users when an app reads the clipboard without the user explicitly pressing 'Paste', however I worry that adding yet more warnings and notifications will result in users becoming fatigued and eventually ignoring them.</p>
<p>Instead, why not allow apps that need to store sensitive data on the clipboard (LastPass, for example) to set a specific data type indicating that the information should be classed as sensitive data - much like they can set the data type to text or image at the moment. In order to paste this &quot;secure object&quot;, users would have to press the system 'Paste' button - any app just reading the clipboard by itself would just see it as empty.</p>
<p>This of course wouldn't solve for cases where data is not known to be sensitive - how many people store their passwords as a simple note instead of in a password manager, for example? Still, fewer notifications and stopping any app from reading passwords from the clipboard might be the right balance.</p>

      <title>BT Milking Customers for Keeping an Email Account</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/07/19/bt-milking-customers-for-keeping-an-email-account/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 15:50:45 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/07/19/bt-milking-customers-for-keeping-an-email-account/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53442244">BBC Money Box reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ofcom also found most people who use an address provided by their broadband company are former BT customers. BT says if customers want to switch provider but keep hold of their old BT email address they're charged £7.50 per month to be able to access and use their account like they used to, including accessing it using an app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading beyond the BBC headline, it turns out that BT are in fact allowing former customers to access their old email account for free, but this only works using a web browser, presumably this is because it's funded by advertisements - I can't see any other reason for this limitation. It is only for continued access via POP/IMAP that BT demand payment for.</p>
<p>Even so, £7.50 a month seems extortionate considering you can get a full Microsoft Exchange account for ~£4.50 a month including VAT.</p>
<p>This kind of exploitative pricing is in poor taste, especially considering that in many cases - the type of customer who still uses their ISP for email is most likely still running Outlook Express - as it was configured in 2007 - and so any change will be more confusing and disorientating than it would for someone who knows how to setup a Gmail account and configure email forwarding (BT do offer forwarding, but I've no idea if this is covered by the free option).</p>
<p>We solved this problem with mobile operators by having rules that mean that as a consumer, you have the right to take your phone number with you when you switch to another operator. Email is unfortunately not regulated in the same way, and in fact its architecture makes it impossible for an email address with the domain &quot;btinternet.com&quot; to be be routed to a server owned by another ISP. Instead, I'd like to see the option to forward emails for free to another email address for a set period of time (say 2 years). If major ISPs and popular webmail providers could somehow automate this process, even better.</p>
<p>Though email is arguably less relevant today than it was 15 years ago, I would still strongly advocate buying your own domain name (around £15 a year) and then setting it up either to forward to a free email account, or even better, paying for proper email with the domain (around £2/month with <a href="https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/email-hosting/standard-email">FastHosts</a>). For those who fancy a technical challenge, for around £4/month you can setup a lightweight Debian VM on somewhere like <a href="https://www.linode.com/pricing/">Linode</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-run-your-own-mail-server-with-mail-in-a-box-on-ubuntu-14-04">run your own mail server</a> - this gives you the benefit of being able to setup unlimited email addressed with your domain - though it's not for the fainthearted.</p>
<p>Either way, £7.50 is a ripoff.</p>

      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/07/19/hey-dot-coms-attitude-is-a-refreshing-change/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've not yet paid for a Hey.com subscription as I'm a strong believer in owning your own domain name for email, but I have to admit I that find their style of business a welcome change to the norm and reminiscent of what I can only imagine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(advertisement)">counter-culture inspired Apple</a> must have been like in the mid 1980s.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/spy-pixels-are-evolving-like-malware-so-heys-adapting/">this recent blog post</a> from their CTO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter GMass, a plugin for Gmail that adds spy-pixel tracking, amongst a grab bag of other stuff. They hadn’t been on our original list of 50+ services we name’n’shame, but thanks to a new blog post where they <a href="https://www.gmass.co/blog/tracking-pixel-blockers/">brag about defeating protections</a> that recipients might take to defend themselves, they came onto our radar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out the makers of this Gmail plugin have used the unimaginative steps of using URLs with no obvious parameters (we called them &quot;friendly URLs&quot; in 2006), encryption of those parameters (not so friendly), and setting up a CNAME record so senders can appear to be hosting the tracking images on their own server, all to try and avoid being tracked by Hey.com (the irony, right?).</p>
<p>Whatever your take on tracking pixels, I just think it's great to see a company saying it how they see it and taking a strong stance. Personally, I've long set my email client <em>never</em> to automatically display images - not so much because of tracking pixels from companies like GMass, but avoid confirming my address whenever I accidentally open up spam.</p>

      <title>Who Left This Server On, for 19 Years?</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maximumpc.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>The Maximum PC site is still online to this day, as it was when it was abandoned in 2001</p>
<p>On the most recent episode of <a href="https://atp.fm">ATP</a>, John Siracusa referenced once of his early Mac OS X reviews. This prompted me to revisit his review of the Mac OS X public beta, as the evolution of computer interfaces is something that I find fascinating.</p>
<p>In one of his screenshots, he <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/archive/mac-os-x-beta/world-view-big.jpg">shows</a> the Ars Technica home page. At the top of the page is a banner informing readers that Ars is part of the &quot;<a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/future-launches-new-uk-web-network/43662">Maximum PC Network</a>&quot;. I immediately recalled this web site, as it was closely related to many other publications I was into at the time, including <a href="https://imarc.me/2020/06/21/farewell-net-magazine/">.net magazine</a>. So, I decided to see what became of the Maximum PC Network by visiting its site in 2020. I expected to find a domain for sale, or it redirecting to a parent company - but no, to my surprise, <strong><a href="https://maximumpc.co.uk">maximumpc.co.uk</a></strong> is still online, and is still showing the date of when it was presumably last updated - <strong>26th February 2001</strong>. Complete with references to <em>em@il</em> and asking whether <em>Windows XP</em> is worth upgrading to, the site is straight out of 2001, but amazingly - still online. Some server, somewhere in 2020 has been left running sine 2001.</p>
<p>I'd love to know the story of how this has happened - how does someone forget a web site existed, but continue to pay for its hosting – even going as far as renewing the SSL certificate each year? That said, I think it's great and I wish more web sites could stay online once they are abandoned.</p>

      <title>AirPods: now less disposable</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/23/airpods-now-less-disposable/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2020 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/23/airpods-now-less-disposable/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>An Apple announcement from WWDC 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To reduce battery aging, AirPods learn from your daily charging routine so they can wait to finish charging past 80% until you need to use them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have long speculated that the reason AirPods are much more <a href="https://imarc.me/2020/03/05/airpods-pro/">disposable</a> when compared to other Bluetooth devices is that fact that their poor batteries are pretty much always in constant use. They are always either in the case <strong>charging</strong>, or in your ears <strong>discharging</strong>.</p>
<p>I own a pair of Plantronics wireless headphones from 2015 that have much better battery life than my AirPods which were purchased in 2016. I know there are many factors at work but the speed at which the batteries on AirPods decline is staggering. I suspect (and hope) this update will dramatically increase the longevity of AirPods.</p>
<p>Great work Apple.</p>

      <title>Farewell .net Magazine</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/21/farewell-net-magazine/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 20:46:23 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/21/farewell-net-magazine/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across the sad news that <em>.net - the internet magazine</em> published its last issue in April 2020.</p>
<p>.net magazine was hugely influential to me as a teenager, capturing the excitement of the Internet in the late 90s. Some of my earliest memories of using the Internet revolve around .net magazine. Within its pages I learnt many things about how the Internet works; how to configure domain names, what emoticons meant, tips to avoid spam, what a flamewar was and how to solve problems with Netscape and Outlook Express, to name a few. The first issue I remember buying (issue 54 if I recall correctly, in late 1998) even had an interview with David Bowie, talking about amongst other things, his recently launched Internet Service Provider (ISP), BowieNet. Bowie was incredibly <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/music/this-david-bowie-clip-from-1999-eerily-predicted-how-we-use-the-internet-today/ar-BB15vKIC">forward thinking</a>, however music artists running their own ISPs never did take off (though I seem to recall some who’ve been successful at making headphones). <em><a href="https://imarc.co.uk/david-bowie-netmag-interview/">[Update: it was issue 55, and I've scanned the Bowie interview for anyone interested]</a></em></p>
<p>Even now, 22 years later, I can recall the excitement of installing the Internet Explorer 5 beta from the cover CD and marvelling at how it dramatically changed the way Windows 98 operated. Strangely, I have a memory of disconnecting from the Internet, in order to phone a hotline to get a code that would let me use one of the applications included on the cover CD, &quot;Starfish Internet Sidekick&quot;. The code was &quot;MANAGER&quot;. It's weird how such memories stick with us. My first look at Mac OS X was from a preview in .net magazine, which touted its photorealistic icons and UNIX underpinnings - I never thought back then that one day in the year 2020 I'd be sitting at a laptop writing this, running the same OS, still using essentially the same UI paradigm, only with far less photorealistic icons.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/netmag.png?w=874" alt=""></p>
<p>As a teenager who wasn't really into books, .net magazine taught me more than how to use the Internet - it helped me to increase my reading age, develop an inner voice and writing style that is still with me today.</p>
<p>What I looked forward to each month the most however, was waiting to see if any of my forum posts had been picked for inclusion in the 'penny arcade' section - where four or five of the funniest posts from the .net forums were featured in the magazine. I don't think my posts contained enough witticisms to make it into the magazine, but just the possibility was exciting.</p>
<p>The .net forums were a magical community of likeminded geeks, mostly in their teens, who just loved the Internet. These days, nobody &quot;loves the Internet&quot; as we did then. Today that would be like having &quot;electricity&quot; as a hobby. Yet back from around 1999 to 2001, the .net forums were where I spent a considerable amount of time socialising (though at the age of 15, my parents didn't think of it as being very social). I remember posting a message to the Futurenet NNTP server through Outlook Express and within minutes getting a reply. It was like Reddit, but far more humane, and because there were only about 20 or so regulars, it felt like a real community. I remember the <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/dev/220169/programming-windows-microsoft-announces-net">Microsoft .NET announcement</a> - how could Microsoft steal the name of our beloved magazine? Waiting for the world to end as Nostradamus predicted in 1999, checking that the internet still worked on January 1st 2000, and posting a link to my latest Geocities creation to the reader's site newsgroup - eagerly awaiting feedback from fellow readers - all on the .net forums. The community faltered slightly when Future Publishing closed down the NNTP servers and moved the forums to web-based software. Thankfully many of forum regulars found a new home on IRC in #netmag on the <a href="http://blitzed.org">Blitzed</a> network. There I would spend whole weekends chatting to my friends on IRC, in-between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_Classic">TFC</a> sessions. It wasn't long after that we built a site called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000817024640/http://www.dfnet.co.uk/aboutus_team.asp">DFNET - The .net reader's site netw</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000817024713/http://www.dfnet.co.uk/articles_forumlife.asp">ork</a>&quot; which further reinforced the sense of community between readers.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_7297.jpg?w=225" alt=""></p>
<p>That idea of having your own website and even forming a community of sites is something I miss from today's Internet. <a href="https://anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/">The web is now so centralised</a>. How many ISPs even bother offering free webspace today? Back then, out of the entire online population, there was a disproportionate percentage of computer enthusiasts online, and so learning HTML and how FTP works was a challenge they would gladly take on. People created web pages about cooking, Half Life and the X-Files. It's easy to look back and laugh at the animated Gifs, the &quot;best viewed in Internet Explorer 4&quot; badges and the &quot;Sign my Guestbook&quot; links - but a part of me mourns the loss of this amateur enthusiasm - the web is now so much more polished and corporate, and &quot;user generated content&quot; mostly resides on major platforms like Twitter, Facebook and IMDB. I would love for Internet providers and OS manufactures to activity encourage people to make their own websites again (remember when Windows used to include FrontPage Express?), but I think that is sadly a pipe-dream and the reality is most people aren't interested. With modern broadband connections, personal websites could even be hosted at home - unrealistic - but part of me is nostgltigc for the dream of an Internet where everyone is an equal player.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/russty_russ/status/377116375250370560</p>
<p>I must have stopped subscribing to .net sometime in 2002. By then, the Internet seemed less interesting to me. Perhaps due to the .com crash or because I was 17, now at college with a Saturday job, and for some reason didn't have time for it any more. Aged 17, the gap between 1999 and 2002 felt like a lifetime. Now, aged 35, three years ago seems like yesterday. The magazine eventually morphed into a web design magazine, focusing less on Internet culture and more on design trends and technical implementation. I picked it up again in 2009 for a year or so but as I became more professionally interested in server side technologies the design centric content wasn't as appealing to me (I am no designer!).</p>
<p>Although I hadn't read it for a many years, hearing of its demise did make me sad that a part of my childhood is no longer. I'm gutted for those who worked at the magazine and may now be out of a job. Wouldn't it be a nice gesture if Future Publishing produced PDFs of the magazine archives (they surely must exist, right?) and put them online for historical record? I could genuinely lose hours reading Internet articles from 2000.</p>
<p>Anyway, goodbye <em>.net</em>, it was a blast.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>With all the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Hey.com&amp;src=typed_query">kerfuffle</a> over Hey.com - an exciting new email service from the makers of Basecamp, it's important to remember that if it takes off, Hey.com will be in a similar position to Apple. Groundskeeper of the walled garden.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272968382329942017</p>
<p>While the service appears to be a refreshingly original rethink on how email should work (I've not signed up myself), it appears to be designed to lock users in. There is no way to use an external email client, and right now there is no support for custom domains (despite being targeted at business users with a $99/year charge - they say its coming). You'll also have to continue to pay if you decide to move to a different provider but want to keep your Hey.com address forwarding. I see no reason why the features advertised (great as they are) couldn't be part of an email client designed by Hey.com - using a combination of cloud services and native clients, Hey could provide a powerful front-end to any open email service such as Outlook.com or Gmail which provide access via IMAP.</p>
<p>Instead it seems they want to lock customers in, which goes against the open, standards based approach that has made email so successful so far. Putting aside the fact Google or Microsoft could easily copy any of these features, and probably will, this is a service I'll be skipping.</p>
<p><strong>Update: thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/shauny/status/1274321206020358146?s=21">Shauny</a> for informing me that Hey.com does in fact offer free forwarding for life for customers who pay for a year's service.</strong></p>

      <title>My First Smartwatch, Aged 11</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/31/my-first-smartwatch-aged-11/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 15:26:08 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/31/my-first-smartwatch-aged-11/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_6414.jpg?w=300" alt=""></p>
<p>As someone who is fascinated by technology and its societal impact, I often think back to the first piece of technology I remember owning as a child: A Casio <em><a href="https://lostinlogicblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/casio-telememo-50.png?resize=107%2C107">Telememo 50</a></em> digital watch (<em>photo from the <a href="https://issuu.com/retromash/docs/argossuperstore-1996-springsummer">Argos catalog</a> I would have ordered it from</em>).</p>
<p>Back in 1996, the idea of storing phone numbers on your wrist was a niche that probably only appealed to geeks like me. Now, in 2020 millions of people walk around with smartwatches and don't even realise they have their contacts synchronised to their wrist.</p>
<p>I can't find the exact model I owned as a child, the photograph above is the nearest I've been able to find on Amazon, and is unfortunately not as good.</p>
<p>Here's what I remember being so cool about my first smartwatch in 1996:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The blue illuminator backlight</strong> looked so cool in the dark. I was always worried about using it however, as it drained the battery big time, and aged 11 new batteries aren't easy to come by. Best thing though? It flashed when the alarm went off.</li>
<li><strong>The hourly time signal</strong> - during school assemblies, from about 5 minutes to the hour until about 5 minutes after, there was a chorus of &quot;beep beep&quot; sounds as everyone's Casio watches went off. Mine of course would always be perfectly always accurate as I would set it to the time shown on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceefax">Ceefax</a> (much cheaper than the other option of phoning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaking_clock#United_Kingdom">speaking clock</a>).</li>
<li><strong>World time</strong> - At 11 years old, I had no need to know the time in other countries but it was so cool being able to tell my friends, uncles, and aunts what time it was in New York when I visited them.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduled alarms</strong> - Long before anyone would dream of being able to set a calendar appointment on their phone (an Americanism - back then we'd have called it a 'diary entry'), my watch would let you set an alarm for a specific time, on a specific date. Whether you'd hear it or not was a different matter. I didn't have many events happening aged 11, but I do remember setting it for my <a href="https://twitter.com/CosmeticPolemic/status/1222996113952772096">occasional hospital appointments</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Water resistant</strong> - I wore this thing swimming, in the shower, in the sea. Quite a novelty at the time to be able to have an alarm go off to remind you its time to get out of the pool.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/casio-telememo.png?w=217" alt=""></p>
<p>If my 11 year old self had any sense, he would have kept this watch, but alas it is sadly most likely to be landfill somewhere now. I've found a similar one on Amazon, but it has far fewer features and doesn't look anywhere near as cool.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Microsoft 'to replace journalists with robots'&quot; from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52860247">BBC News</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is to replace dozens of contract journalists on its MSN website and use automated systems to select news stories, US and UK media report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd love to know why <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2020/05/30/dozens-of-msn-journalists-to-be-replaced-by-robots/">so</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2020/05/30/dozens-of-msn-journalists-to-be-replaced-by-robots/">many</a> <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/microsoft-replace-journalists-robots-a4455336.html">news</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-news-cuts-dozens-of-staffers-in-shift-to-ai-2020-5">organisations</a> are using the term &quot;<em>robots</em>&quot; to describe algorithmic selection of content. Google has been doing this since 2002 with Google News, so I'm surprised that this is even news (though I'm of course sad for those who are now out of a job). I've always thought the term &quot;robot&quot; to be a pointless one. We don't call our washing machines robots, so why would we call any other machine that isn't anthropomorphised a robot?</p>
<p>I can't help thinking this is also being used as an excuse to remind people MSN News still exists.</p>

      <title>After 5 Years, the Apple Watch Still Can’t Sync as Reliably as the iPod</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ipod-sync-2001-1.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>The Apple Watch is great for many things, but listening to music or podcasts is still problematic. Apple haven't been able to solve what, on the face of it, seems like a simple challenge: synchronising content to the watch.</p>
<p>While you can now stream music and podcasts, theoretically removing the need to synchronise media, in practise many people (such as myself) live in areas where 4G signal is poor, simply don't want to, or own a watch without a data plan.</p>
<p>The solution Apple seems to have proposed is to simply mark content you want to be stored on the watch, and let them do the rest, at their time of choosing. This leads to random frustrations because inevitably this &quot;smart synchronisation&quot; doesn't sync the right content at the right time. Sometimes transfers only happen when the watch is plugged in, other times they seemingly get stuck and drain the battery right down. Due to the fact that watchOS is very restricted in what it can do, there is no room for third party applications to try and do better either. The experience of setting off for a run only to find the latest episode of your favourite podcast isn't available is surely familiar to any Apple Watch owner.</p>
<p>What I'd like to see is a way to from the watch itself, select a song, album or podcast and have it transferred over from my phone there and then. No &quot;pending&quot;, no waiting for a charger to be attached - just do it right now, so I can go for my run, and please Apple - show a progress bar while you're at it - like iTunes did in 2001. <strong>If having a power source is really needed, then tell me to charge the watch there and then, and <strong>instead of nightstand mod</strong>e, show a progress bar while the watch is on the charger.</strong> This functionality needs to be made available to third party applications such as <a href="http://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> too.</p>
<p>While I'd love for synchronisation to be automatic and happen at night without me knowing, in practise this doesn't seem to work. I missed many buses as a teenager waiting for my iPod to sync and while I don't take the bus as much these days, it's somewhat reassuring to know things haven't changed that much as I sit and wait for my Apple Watch to sync before I leave the house. The difference is my iPod would generally work first time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are most likely to catch the SARS-CoV-2 virus by spending a long time near an infected person in an enclosed space. Researchers in Guangzhou, China, examined how the virus was transmitted between 347 people with confirmed infections and the people they had contact with. They found that the risk of the infection being passed on at home or by repeated contact with the same person was approximately 10 times greater than the risk of passing it on in a hospital and 100 times greater than doing so on public transport (medRxiv, doi.org/dwgj).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably the most informative, accessible and actionable article I've read about minimising Coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>It's all very well asking people to use &quot;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52612449">common sense</a>&quot;, but vast swathes of the population don't know how viruses spread. Take for example the tradesperson who came to visit my house recently to fix a problem with a door. While he demonstrated plenty of common sense in being able to fix the problem (10 minutes to fix something that I had spent hours trying to fix and couldn't), he also wore a face-mask so low down on his face that I could see his top lip. One motto I've taken with me throughout my life is that there is no such thing as &quot;common sense&quot;.</p>

      <title>Why Zoom and not FaceTime?</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/25/why-zoom-and-not-facetime/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Bradley Chambers writing on 9to5Mac:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rise of Zoom could be the headline for the 2020 technology scene. Zoom has replaced classrooms, board meetings, concerts, and even some low budget sporting events. What I find interesting about Zoom is how it took off for video communications while we had other services that were better in a lot of ways. I particularly want to look at FaceTime during COVID-19, and how despite having a nearly decade long existence and being built into every iOS and macOS device, it didn’t have its ‘Zoom’ moment, and why Zoom became the new default group video service. It doesn’t work on Windows, Android, and the web</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There have long been rumours that Apple have FaceTime and iMessage running on Android in a bunker somewhere. The global health crisis and resulting lockdown would have been the perfect opportunity to put customers before the need to lock them into an ecosystem, and release them both for Android. If it’s not already a product that’s ready to go, then I can’t see a good reason not to build it now. I don’t buy an iPhone because it has FaceTime or iMessage, and I’m not sure who would. Messaging and video calling are now commoditised. WhatsApp, Houseparty and of course Zoom are ubiquitous and cross platform. In the end, it’s because of Apple’s stubbornness that their own customers are forced to use less secure, less privacy-aware battery-draining alternatives.</p>

      <title>Running metrics on Apple Watch</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/25/running-metrics-on-apple-watch/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/25/running-metrics-on-apple-watch/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Apple Watch allows the information displayed while running to be customised. You can either choose to show a single metric at a time and swipe through them app, or you can choose to see multiple metrics, of which you can choose up to 5. You don't need to fill up all 5 slots however, and choosing fewer pieces of information means the metrics that are shown will be bigger and more legible. After using the Apple Watch for running for 5 years now, I've settled on the following metrics.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_6366.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Distance So Far</strong> - While I don't particularly care about time elapsed, knowing the elapsed distance allows me to know how far there is to go, and therefore how much energy I can afford to expend.</p>
<p><strong>Current Heart Rate</strong> - The speed of the heart is a good indicator of how hard you're working. I generally know if I'm above 185 then I'm putting in a lot of effort. A more relaxed run should be between 140 and 167. However if it's particularly hot, or I'm coming down with something then my heart rate will be higher even if I'm not running at my usual pace - therefore I'll want to take it easier than usual to avoid overly fatiguing my body.</p>
<p><strong>Current Pace</strong> - I've always worked in kilometres when running, possibly because this is how the treadmills worked at the gym I belonged to when I first started out running. Knowing your current speed is of course the best way to make sure you're on track to finish in the time you planned to.</p>
<p><strong>Average Pace</strong> - This among with a bit of mental maths let's me know my predicted finish time. I know whether I should speed up or hold off the gas slightly. One thing I wish Apple would add is the ability to see your predicted finish time instead, based on your average pace.</p>
<p><strong>Average Cadence (Steps Per Minute)</strong> - Knowing my cadence is for me the best indicator of whether I'm running well. When I'm tired I am prone to running with bad technique and this usually coincides with a lower SPM. Making sure I keep above 175 reminds me to avoid stomping and focus on posture and arm movement, crucial factors when trying to avoid injury. I tend to get better times with a higher SPM too.</p>

      <title>Microsoft Edge is Finally Very Good</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/23/microsoft-edge-is-finally-very-good/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 13:53:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/05/23/microsoft-edge-is-finally-very-good/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For a software company, Microsoft has an inconsistent track record when it comes to actually producing decent software. I can only imagine a lot of this may stem from internal politics and design by committee. Their failure to piece together a decent web browser over the last decade was starting to become down right embarrassing for a company which once held 95% of the browser marketshare. Back “in the day’, Internet Explorer was without question the best web browser out there. It wasn’t until Microsoft disbanded the IE team, Firefox came along, and later Google Chrome, that IE started to look like old-hat. The Trident engine was dragged kicking and screaming into the touchscreen age but was never able to keep up, in terms of both features and performance. Even a rebrand from from the 90’s inspired Internet Explorer to the play on words that is “Edge” (Edge was the name of a mode for Internet Explorer that was on the “bleeding edge” and would allowed the latest HTML features to be supported) couldn’t save it.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/screenshot-2020-05-23-at-14.10.07.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Now though Edge has been reborn using the same engine as Chrome, Blink. Gone is the legacy of Trident. Now we have what is essentially Google Chrome but without the annoying things Google likes to do. It’s strange, but it’s similar to Netscape and Mozilla. Netscape after being bought by AOL ended up being bloated out as a way to sell other products. Chrome feels this way these days. Privacy enhancing settings are buried deep in the settings so that no casual user would every find them. That and the browser really wants you to sign into your Google account and synchronise everything, even if you really don’t want to. Edge however is a breath for fresh air. On my 7 year old MacBook it flies by, and anecdotally seems faster than Safari. It supports Chrome plugins, and so is actually better than Safari in this respect. Safari took the regressive decision to require plugins install a full Mac application. On my even older Windows laptop, Edge manages to hide the hardware’s age with surprising grace. Microsoft make it easy to turn off 3rd party cookies and offer other privacy enhancing settings. The browser seems to be written for users and not for the benefit of its creator, a sure good sign. If you decide you don’t want to sign in, it’s not overly pushy about reminding you, even though I'm likely to actually trust Microsoft with my bookmarks and browsing history, and so will probably end up creating an account.</p>
<p>It feels odd seeing the word “Favourites” instead of “Bookmarks” in the menu bar. It takes me back to using the web as a teenager in the late 90s and using the last version of Internet Explorer for Mac on Mac OS X version 1 back in 2001.</p>
<p>At work, I’ve switched from Firefox to Edge. At home, I’m seriously considering switching from Safari to Edge. The only thing holding me back is the lack of synchronised reading list between Safari on my iPhone. When Apple eventually allow Edge to become the default browser on iOS too, I’ll give it more serious consideration.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of things like enjoy about iOS is the attention to detail and inclusion of features that few people would think to ask for, but that vastly improve our quality of life. One such thing is the ability to keep track of audio levels of your headphones over time. If you are using headphones that support this feature (no surprise - <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph1df080ecc/ios">Apple</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/08/hearing-with-ios-13-and-watchos-6/">Beats</a> both do) then you’ll see entries in the Health app when you play audio from your iPhone or Apple Watch (phone calls, and sounds played from an iPad or Mac are not included) you’ll see a log of the decibel level and clear advice on whether you’ve been playing your music too loud. I wish this feature had been available on iPods when they first came out. Since I was 23 I’ve had mild tinnitus, likely down to listening to music on the bus every day as I went to and from college. Now I can make sure my dB level never is never too high, and even try to keep it as low as possible (thanks to noise cancelling headphones).</p>

<p>Yet one more feature Apple have added to iOS that would make it difficult to switch to Android.</p>

      <title>AirPods Pro</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/03/05/airpods-pro/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 14:06:06 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2020/03/05/airpods-pro/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve had the AirPods Pro for just over two months now, so I’m posting my thoughts in the hope that someone might find it useful to get a ‘normal’ person’s review. By ‘normal’, I mean someone isn’t a technology reviewer by profession, and so doesn’t receive the latest gadgets on a weekly basis, and as someone who had to shell out their own hard earned money for the privilege! (On a tangent, there are some great YouTube channels out there reviewing gadgets, but as soon as the creator goes ‘pro’ and suddenly has a £2,000 laptop or £1,200 phone every week, they loose part of what made them interesting, in my humblest of opinions).</p>
<h2>AirPods Classic</h2>
<p>I’ve been using AirPods since 2017 – boy does time fly, it seems like yesterday. I was immediately a fan. The main selling point for me was the fact there was no ‘on/off’ button, and you didn’t need to worry about leaving them switched on. I was forever leaving my other bluetooth headphones powered on and in my bag, and then getting frustrated when Siri didn’t work because it was listening to me through the headset and not my phone’s microphone. AirPods solved this brilliantly. The fact they were such an elegant package, and worked so seamlessly with the Apple Watch was also really cool. I swear running without my brick of an iPhone 8 Plus helps me get a better time. I still use my 2017 ‘original generation’ AirPods regularly, although the battery life is now a little under 2 hours when listening to music, or about 45 minutes if making a call. I can’t help but think the relatively quick degradation of AirPods’ battery compared to say my Plantronics BackBeat FIT (which I’ve had since 2015 and still manage 5 hours) is due to the fact they are constantly charging in the case when not in use. Apple released a feature for the iPhone in iOS 13 that stops your phone from charging all night, in order to lengthen the battery longevity. Using that same logic, being plugged in 90% of the time must take its toll on the AirPods’ battery. Needless to say, the convenience, small size and sheer utility meant I was excited about upgrading the the AirPods Pro.</p>
<h2>Fit &amp; Style</h2>
<p>The biggest noticeable difference with the AirPods Pro is the shape and size. Gone is the long pole that hangs down form your ears. Objectively, the AirPods Pro probably look better than the classic style of AirPods, however the classic AirPods are so ubiquitous now that what once seemed ridiculous now comes across as quite fashionable. If anything, I can see the classic AirPods (which Apple continues to sell) being more popular with younger, more cash-strapped individuals, and consequently more fashionable. Due to their price, AirPods Pro are more likely to be seen on middle-aged IT workers, which may limit their fashion appeal. Despite that, they fit exceptionally well thanks to the three sizes of ear-tips that come in the box, and a built in software utility that helps you to determine if you have a good fit for noise isolation. They are slightly more fiddly to put away than the originals – I find the ear tips often fold inside-out when I remove them from my ears which can be annoying. On the whole though, a better fit means better sounding music. The classic AirPods had terrible noise isolation, so much so that I couldn’t use them on the train in the summer when the windows were open. As a sufferer of tinnitus since I was 23, I am very conscious of not increasing the sound levels on headphones above the EU recommend limit. With AirPods Pro’s more secure fit, I rarely need the volume above 75%.</p>
<h2>Sound Quality</h2>
<p>There’s a lot to be said for the line of thinking that goes: the more you pay for a pair of headphones, the better they sound. Just knowing you have a pair of premium, 24-bit, gold plated headphones can cause a placebo effect in of itself. The AirPods Pro however, do genuinely sound amazing. I’ve heard parts of songs I’d not noticed before: previously hidden rhythm guitar sections, or faint backing vocals. This is on songs I’ve been listening to for 20+ years. The AirPods Pro sound great. The biggest new feature, Active Noice Cancelation (ANC) is extremely good too. I’ve only ever had one pair of noise cancelling headphones before, the Plantronics BackBeat Focus – my office daily driver for Skype Calls. I’d say the AirPods Pro’s ANC is much better, especially considering their small size. I don’t travel often, but I did a short flight recently and was able to listen my AirPods Pro at about 40% volume with ANC switched on which was outstanding. When out and about, Transparency mode does an exceptional job at passing through the sounds of the world around – essentially for walking or running on country lanes against the traffic, as I do frequently. It’s an odd sensation, it seems to slightly increase the higher range meaning you notice the birds singing more than usual. After a while it’s easy to forget you are wearing the AirPods as the outside world sounds so natural, except if it’s windy. I’ve found that running or walking in a breeze does lead to an uncomfortable sensation of of what sounds like someone blowing directly into your ears. I’m surprised there was no way with all the technology onboard this sound could be offset, but I imagine that’s not an easy problem to solve. I hope Apple can improve this with a software update. It’s not a deal breaker, but it’s also not something I’ve ever noticed with other headphones before.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>With the classic AirPods, you could double tap either side to invoke Siri, or trigger play/pause – depending on your configuration. With the new AirPods, double tapping is gone. Instead you need to squeeze the tip. This is more flexible as you can now either press once, twice or three times for play pause, skip forward and skip backward respectively. Pressing and holding switches between ANC and Transparency mode. Overall it’s a better system however I’ve noticed that I often pull the AirPod slightly out of my ear when using this control mechanism, which means I inadvertently loose the seal needed for decent noice cancellation. Siri is as inconsistent as ever. Unlike my OG AirPods, there’s no need to double-tap, I can just shout ‘Hey Siri’. Sometime Siri works like magic – ask it to turn on transparency mode, or lower the volume and 70% of the time it responds instantaneously saying ‘Okay, done’. The rest of the time however, it either takes too long that you doubt yourself – did I say the right thing? – and end up getting your phone out of your pocket, or it gets the wrong idea completely. There is something infuriating about requesting your favourite song, and having your phone proudly inform you it’s going to play a totally different song, from a genre you can’t stand, at maximum volume. Once thing I do notice is you need to say “Hey Siri’ pretty loud. Probably no louder than normal conversation, but louder than I’d like to when I’m in a public place. There’s something about asking your phone to remind you about buying toilet paper, or to send a text your significant other with a question asking them what they want for dinner that means I don’t want to scream it like Dom Joly.</p>
<p>A feature I have enjoyed is one hidden away under the notification settings for iMessage that allows messages to be announced and read by Siri when they arrive. This is genuinely cool, but I’m flummoxed as to why it’s only available on AirPods. Yes you can reply instantly without needed to say ‘Hey Siri’ which requires some clever work by Apple, but I’d be willing to forgo this if I could have this feature in my car too. It’s also of limited use because it doesn’t work with WhatsApp, which is the de facto SMS replacement in the UK.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>I’m very impressed and would recommend them to anyone in the market for some premium headphones. Then again, for a staggering £250, I expect to be impressed. I understand there’s a lot of new technology in these, but I feel £199 would have been more reasonable for something with a 3-year lifespan. The main downside of the AirPods is their limited lifespan. For 2-3 year however, expect to enjoy great sounding music.</p>

      <title>The Card Missing From Our Digital Wallets</title>

      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2019/12/31/the-card-missing-from-our-digital-wallets/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're lucky enough to own a smartphone these days, as most people do, then you can most likely use it to replace your wallet. With Apple Pay and Google Pay, you can spend money without the need for cash for bank cards. Store Cards such as Tesco Clubcard can also be placed in your digital wallet. I even store my library card on my phone thanks to <a href="https://www.pass2u.net">this app</a> which lets you digitise any barcode based pass and place it in your Apple Wallet.  I'm so used to this situation now, that I rarely go out with a wallet on my person. Once train ticket machines started taking contactless there really was no need.  One less thing to lose, one less thing to remember. However I ran into a slight hitch the other day when I ordered something online from for pickup in an Apple Store. I placed the order while walking through the shopping centre, knowing the item was in stock and would be ready for me to pick up within 30 minutes.  I paid using Apple Pay on my phone, and an order ticket was placed into my digital wallet. About 10 minutes later a notification appeared on my phone saying it was ready for pickup. Excited, I took the escalator to the upper floor of the shopping mall and walked into the Apple Store, phone in hand, QR code ready on the screen.  All went well until the Apple Store employee asked to see some identification. I had none. Why Would I? I use a digital wallet. In many respects, I am the prototypical Apple Customer, using minimal time from staff and making my purchase online using Apple Pay, from an iPhone. Yet they wouldn't give me my new AirPods without seeing some form of identification. While I understand that you can't just handover expensive items without some kind of validation in place, I was surprised that Apple, of all companies, did not have a digital alternative in place. You could argue it's not the role of Big Tech to be creating digital ID cards, and perhaps there are benefits to plastic-based identification. In the UK, thankfully there are no laws requiring citizens to carry identification (even when driving). That said, I'd love to see a solution that works in tandem with our existing systems and doesn't exclude anyone who doesn't own a smartphone, or wants to keep using plastic ID.</p>

<p>I thought I was just unlucky. It seemed that around 50% of the time I tried to exit a train station by inserting my ticket into the barrier, I'd receive a message asking me to seek assistance. Whether starting or finishing the journey in my local town of Reading or further afield, it seemed to happen very frequently, while everyone else seemed to strut through the barrier with no problem at all.</p>
<p>Today it finally clicked. I've been putting my train ticket in my pocket along with my AirPods. The charging case has the same satisfying click as you close it as a premium brand car does when shutting the door. It achieves this using <em>magnets</em>. My theory is that the magnets are interfering with the magnetic strip on the train ticket.</p>
<p>Paper train tickets probably aren't long for this world anyway, but if you're also experiencing the humiliation of having to speak to an actual human being on your commute, check your AirPods or other devices bearing magnets aren't near your ticket.</p>

      <title>Error: Workshop! Only leave vehicle in position P</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Volkswagen</strong> taking the <strong>biscuit</strong></h1>
<p>Within weeks of buying my car, a four-year old 2015 Volkswagen Polo 1.2 TSI SE 5d DSG, I discovered that I would occasionally be presented with an error message while driving stating &quot;<strong><em>Error: Workshop! Only leave vehicle in position P.</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/workshop_error.jpeg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Although most of the time the audible tone and error message would disappear within five to ten seconds, it was disconcerting all the same, and a distraction while driving. For a long time I've been a &quot;Do Not Disturb While Driving&quot; convert, making use of iOS's ability to silence notifications while I'm in the car. An alert that beeps and lights up your dashboard with a warning light is dangerous in its own right. If my car incorrectly thinks it's in the workshop, or my gear shift should be somewhere else, that's dangerous too.</p>
<p>Like any good millennial, I googled the error message and quickly found forum posts from other VW owners who'd seen the same message. The consensus was that it was caused by a faulty gear selector, and since it's a known manufacturing fault, the forum posts informed me VW have a service bulletin out and their technicians should be able to identify and rectify the problem swiftly. Knowing I had one year's warranty included with my purchase, I booked my car into the VW garage I'd bought the car from, who after a couple of hours told me they couldn't find anything wrong. They said to see if it happens again and bring it back if it did. They left me their standard complimentary biscuit and I was sent on my way. Surprised by this, but trusting Volkswagen (and enjoying my sugar fix), I went away hoping the error, which had only occurred two or three times, would go away by itself.</p>
<p>Skip forward a few months and the error had reoccurred, and I'd also seen estimates that the cost of a new gear selector could run into the thousands. The error had kept happening every few weeks. At the same time I'd noticed my coolant kept dropping down below it's expected level: I had a slow leak in my cooling system. When I booked this in to get fixed under warranty, I asked them to look at the &quot;workshop!&quot; error too. Again, they found nothing, but did replace my cooling system, over a thousand pounds worth of repairs. Surprising for a car that was only four years old, I was grateful for the warranty and another complimentary biscuit.</p>
<p>A month or two later, the message starting appearing more frequently. I booked it in again, keen to get it resolved before my one year warranty expired (even though as a manufacturing fault, VW should really cover it anyway). This time I told the them there were many forum posts stating it was probably the gear selector, and showed them a video I'd taken of the error (this was difficult to do without breaking the law, but thankfully on at least one occasion the error remained until I was parked off the road and able to take a photo).</p>
<p>After a having the car for a few hours, I was the told the error could be fixed by a software update to my infotainment system, and that as software isn't covered under warranty I'd have to pay a £110 diagnostic fee. Even after explaining the forum posts saying it's the gear selector, they insisted it was a software problem. Not happy about having to pay to fix a fault, I insisted I shouldn't have to pay. The garage wouldn't budge, stating that the warranty only covers mechanical and electrical faults. Even when I explained that software is powered by electricity and so is <em>technically</em> electrical, they refused to waive the fee. In the end I had to phone Volkswagen HQ, and after expressing my frustration and disappointment in Volkswagen in no uncertain terms, they were able to convince the garage to let me off the fee as a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot;.</p>
<p>While doubtful the software update would resolve the problem, I gave the technicals who work for Volkswagen the benefit of the doubt and hoped they had finally fixed this annoying and dangerous error message. I also got a another biscuit.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/biscuit.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>About a week after this, the alert showed again. In fact, it now started showing up more frequently. Sometimes multiple times in one journey, and sometimes not disappearing until I stopped the car and restarted the engine. I phoned Volkswagen again, this time in full &quot;angry consumer&quot; mode and, exacerbated by their inability to fix an issue that a simple web search returns a solution for.</p>
<p>For the fourth time, I dropped my car off. They had preordered a replacement gear selector this time, and so I was quietly confident it would be fixed. About six hours after handing over my car, I received a phone call informing that they had indeed found it was the gear selector and there was even a technical bulletin about this very fault. Thankfully there was no difference of opinion with warranty cover. 10 months into my 12 month warranty, I was reassured.</p>
<p>This was two days ago. I've not seen the message since. My fingers are crossed that this will indeed fix it, but after this experience, in all honesty, I'm not holding my breath. I think they’ve given up with the biscuits now. It’s disappointing but probably better for my health considering how many times I’ve had to go back.</p>
<p>If you experience this error, don’t give up. Mine got worse over time, so get it fixed- no matter how many times they push you away with free confectionary. It’s the gear selector!</p>

      <title>AirPods</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When Apple first announced the AirPods there was a lot of hyperbole in the media about them being Apple's next big 'wearable' device. For a company that <a href="http://fortune.com/2011/03/05/apples-speeds-and-feeds-is-a-preemptive-strike/">famously said that speeds an feeds did not matter</a>, there was a of emphasis on the fact these headphones contained a &quot;W1&quot; chip that could do all sorts of smarts other headphones could not. I use Bluetooth headphones <a href="http://www.lostinlogic.com/blog/2017/04/running-gadgets/">extensively</a>: at work I have a pair of over-the-ear noice cancelling headphones that double up as a headset for making calls. They are excellent at both cancelling the noise around me so I can't hear it when listening to music, and also at removing external noise so other people can't hear me when I'm phoning them. I also use a different pair for running - they are average sound quality, but they are sweat proof and let in external noise making them safe for road-running. Both these headsets have an onboard chip: The big ones I use in the office are able to tell me if I start speaking and my microphone is muted, alleviating the frustration of sharing your greatest idea on a conference call and wondering why nobody even acknowledged you. The sports pair aren't as sophisticated but can tell me how much battery life I have left, telling me there is some smarts going on inside the headphones. So having 'smarts' inside a pair of headphones is nothing new. I'm sure they could come up with a brand name for their silicone chips to, but to me, the W1 in the AirPods is meaningless in of itself. So what makes the AirPods better than any other headphones? It's the integration between hardware and software - Apple's usual strength. In this case not only the integration between hardware and software on the AirPods themselves, but also between the AirPods' software and the iOS device they're paired to. My biggest frustration with existing Bluetooth headphones is that they stay connected to my phone when I'm not wearing them. How many times have I tried to use Siri, and realised after 3 attempts that it's not working because I've left my Bluetooth headphones on and they're still connected but in my gym bag. AirPods solve this beautifully. The other big problem with Bluetooth that AirPods solve is pairing. Recent Bluetooth headphones are not difficult to pair: there's no passcode (it was always 0000 anyway so it seemed pointless) it's just a case of putting the headset into 'pair mode' and then choosing it from the Bluetooth menu. Unless you've paired it with another device since you last used it with the one you're trying to use it with now, in which case you need to un-pair and re-pair. Usually you need to see a few error message before you realise this is the case. This of course means if you want to use them with that other device again you'll need to repeat the process. Not a big hardship, but a small piece of friction that meant I rarely bothered to use my headphones with other devices. AirPods make switching devices as simple as selecting 'Marc's AirPods' from a menu. No pairing, no need to remember about which device I used last. It's not quite as magic as I had hoped for - it doesn't just know I'm using an iPad now and so switch automatically, but hey you can' have everything. So overall I am impressed with my third set of Bluetooth headphones. The AirPods won't replace my headset at work for calls, because I need noise cancelling at work. I will use them for running, walking and working out however. They are especially good around the house while doing chores etc. Their frictionless nature means I'll use them whenever I would have just use the phone's external speaker before. The quality of phone calls is surprisingly low, making me think Apple's switching to a different Bluetooth profile or something. Hopefully this will be fixed in a firmware update. Some other random thoughts: - Siri is pretty unreliable, it's generally not worth the hassle. In the rare case that it understands what I meant, the phone will often respond by displaying an answer on the screen, defeating the point of using the headset. - They seem very secure in the ears. - They look silly, but so did white earbuds when they first came out. - i sometimes feel a bit self-conscious when wearing them, especially if I'm on a train wearing an Apple Watch and reading on an iPad. I feel like I'm in an Apple advertisement (though I'm not good looking enough to actually be in one). - It seems weird that if I go for a run with my Apple Watch, and my iPhone, and use Siri on the AirPods, I can't start a workout using AirPods because they're connected to the phone. This says more about Siri's inconsistencies than the AirPods. - Opening the case near an iPhone causes a menu to show on the phone with details about the AirPods' battery life. It doesn't do this on iPads and Macs, presumably because it needs NFC, which they don't have, but I'm not sure.</p>

      <title>Can an iPad Replace a Laptop?</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I was <a href="https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2011/08/06/i-did-it-i-bought-an-ipad/index.html">convinced</a> to buy an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/may/28/ipad-regent-street-buyers-survey">iPad</a> 4 years ago, I’ve been a massive fan and predicted they would eventually replace laptops for most consumers. Just as <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130109/steve-jobs-was-right-tablets-are-cars-pcs-are-trucks/">not everyone needs a truck</a>, not everyone needs a laptop right? It turns out however, that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dougolenick/2015/04/30/apple-ipad-shipments-down-23-as-tablet-market-continues-to-lose-steam/">iPad sales are falling</a>. This is more likely a combination of people having much larger phones, iPads being reliable and not needing replacing, lack of innovation (today’s fifth generation iPad does the same as a second generation, only faster), and the fact that the vast majority of consumers don’t need anything more powerful than a phone. It saddens me that despite the Internet being a place where anyone can publish anything at very low cost (or for free in many cases), most people use it to consume TV and post frivolous Facebook updates that don’t require much more than a mobile phone - but that’s another topic altogether. At the other end of the scale you have business and professional users, who tend to use laptops because they offer much more power. Processing power isn’t as far off as you might think, the power difference is now in the software. Take for example a simple task I needed to achieve last week - downloading an MP3 from a web site (legit I might add! It was to accompany a course I was taking) and add it to my iTunes Match Library so it would be available on all of my devices. This is easy to do on a Mac or Windows laptop, but impossible on an iPad. That’s ridiculous. The other software issue that holds back these devices is the transient nature of applications. At any time your application might get terminated due to lack of memory. This rarely results in any loss of work, as developers usually code with this in min (until iOS 4, this happened overtime you left an app). Not many developers both to restore the state of an application (as they are suppose to), and even when they do having to wait for it to load again is painful. So the answer is no, an iPad can’t replace a laptop at the moment. I would like to see Apple push forward with this vision. Why not have a simplified version of Xcode for the iPad? It could be a great way to introduce people to programming (and could feature the Playground function introduced last year). The built in applications should be updated to support ‘Open In’ so I can open that MP3 file in the Music app, for example. For many users, nothing will beat a dual screen setup with a mouse and keyboard - but I can’t help thinking that 90% of my non-work computing needs could be done on an iPad if the software were better.</p>
<h3>Update: 31/5/2015</h3>
<p>I've been using an external keyboard with my iPad a lot recently, so hardware wise it's more on par with a laptop. Here's what I miss most from a full blown Windows/Mac laptop:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to have more than one document open within a single app. Some apps such as Mail support having mutipe drafts open at once, but all the apps I use most frequently such as Microsft Word, Pages and Excel can only open one document at a time. It takes about 30 seconds to close a document and to load another, which just slows me down.</li>
<li>Lack of keyboard shortcuts - such as being able to press 'Enter' to send a message, or CTRL + Enter to send an email. Also being able to switch between documents / apps using the keyboard would help too.</li>
<li>Applications getting unloaded from memory. Or rather lazy developers not bothering to reload the state of an app when it gets reloaded. Again, like with the document switching - it gets in the way when you return to a presentation and find the app has gone back to the open screen.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Take That Photo</title>

<p>These days, we all carry cameras in our pockets. We can capture and record any event with very little effort and at a moment’s notice. Not surprisingly, a backlash has occurred. (From experience, anything that’s easy and rewarding enough for mass adoption is eventually frowned upon by early adopters.)</p>
<p>People are now criticised for filming events instead of ‘being in the moment’. Kate Bush even banned cameras from her much-hyped comeback shows. Amongst all groups of friends, there’s always the inevitable member who photographs and videos the goings-on (that’s usually me), and while they might seem annoying now, in 20 years' time, when you want to look back, you’ll be glad for their amateur documentaries.</p>
<p>Having recently discovered some videos of my family that were taken in the early '90s (when I was five!), I am firmly of the opinion that it’s our duty to make sure future generations have the opportunity to see such material. Seeing your parents and grandparents as young people really changed my view of them, strangely putting my own life into perspective. While I’m sure future generations won’t care to see a Kate Bush concert that will undoubtedly end up being available to buy anyway, seeing their mum, dad, or uncle dancing, smiling, and enjoying the event would be fascinating.</p>
<p>So, lose your cool and get that camera out. Take that photo. You’ll be glad you did.</p>
<p>(Though I’m still not sure about iPads at gigs.)</p>

      <title>Samsung Easy Settings on Windows 8</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2013/06/09/samsung-easy-settings-on-windows-8/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2013 16:34:50 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2013/06/09/samsung-easy-settings-on-windows-8/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Incompatible</h2>
<p>I bought my Samsung laptop well over a year ago, and it came running Windows 7. Despite having the most awful keyboard I have ever used, I’ve stuck with it because the Core i5 is pretty decent, and it’s got plenty of storage for all my music and I’m not going to shell out for a new laptop until this one gives up the ghost.</p>
<p>One of the interesting features that Samsung included was a piece of software called ‘Easy Settings’ which allowed me to configure the battery to never charge above 80%, supposedly lengthening the life of the battery. I turned this on (since my laptop is plugged in 99% of the time) and forgot all about it. A few months later I installed Windows 8 and found that Easy Settings no longer worked. When I tried to install it I got this message:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/82fc1-image.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/e725b-image_thumb.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>Loosing 20% of your battery capacity might be fine around the house, but sometimes I do like to take my laptop out and so I really wanted to be able to configure this. Even forcing Windows to install meant the app would run but wouldn’t display correctly function at all, I guess Microsoft blocked it for a reason.</p>
<h2>Install Version 2.1</h2>
<p>It turns out <a href="http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/SW/201305/20130521090434453/SWUpdate_2.1.15.1.ZIP">Samsung do offer a version of this tool for Windows 8</a>, they just don’t make it easy to find. Version 2.1 works perfectly fine on NP300E5A model. Before I could change any power management settings, I had to update my laptop’s firmware however. The link to the download was hidden away on this <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/win8upgrade/">Windows 8 update page</a>, so check your model is listed before performing any firmware updates!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f48f1-image1.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6ac4f-image_thumb1.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>One nice addition if the ability to turn your laptop into a wireless Access Point (yes, Macs have had this feature for years I know, and it’s very useful).</p>

      <title>10 Years of the iPod</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2011/11/06/10-years-of-the-ipod/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, the iPod turned 10. Hard to believe I know, at the time I’d just recently been bought an iMac (of the original curvy variety) and so I was keeping a close eye on all things Mac (only my AOL dialup connection). I remember reading about the announcement of the iPod and thinking “<em>Wow!”</em> – and feeling pretty smug because as a Mac user I would be able to get one (they were Mac-only to begin with). Of course at the age of 16 £300 for a gadget is hard to come by and so I wait until that Christmas and to my surprise I had an iPod in my stocking.</p>
<p>What struck me was the simplicity and purpose the device was beaming with, it integrated with iTunes so well and songs transferred across at lightening speed. Before the iPod I had been using an MP3 CD player which was a nightmare to navigate, and exceptionally bulky. I was getting the bus to college daily, and I remember I would have to pack it up the stop before because listening on the move wasn’t really an option due to it’s general bulkiness.</p>
<p>Any music player is pretty useless without good music to put on it, at the time I remember listening to Turin Brakes’ debut album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Optimist_LP">The Optimist LP</a>. Even today when I listen to this album, I am reminded of the novelty of the first iPod (as well as standing in freezing January weather waiting for a bus).</p>
<p>Apple released various updates, to support AAC and improve battery life – but the iPod remained the same essentially, a beautiful music player.</p>
<p>By about 2004 my iPod was well and truly battered, this was before it was common knowledge that that “durable” metal back was also very stretchable. I decided to move to a HP PocketPC running Windows Mobile 4, with a 500MB Compact Flash Card. It was nowhere near the 5GB of the iPod, but the geek in me wanted something that could play video and surf the web (using IrDA and GPRS). It was a functional little device, but shoddily built. In 2006 I decided to get an iPod Video 5.5. By now Apple had moved well and truly away from the physical scroll-wheel to a touch-sensitive one – I still use this iPod today and I have never managed to get on with it as well as the first iPod. The video was great though, and the battery was even better. I remember it got me through the hours I had to sit in LAX when my flight was cancelled. That trip was to New York in 2007, a few months after the release of the iPod Touch. After visiting the Apple Store on 5th Avenue, I couldn’t resist the spending my entire holiday money on one of the things and promptly purchased an iPod Touch.</p>
<p>The first generation iPod touch was all about music, and being able to buy it online wherever you were – there were no games, no apps, you couldn’t even edit calendar appointments – this was all about the music (and video). It was therefore a nice addition when Apple released an update (I think it cost about £5) that gave users the ability to install apps.The iPod Touch was also the first time I had ever used a mobile browser and actually enjoyed the experience. My phone at the time (a Nokia N95) was a great phone, but browsing the web it it was awful.</p>
<p>The iPod Touch, like the iPod Video I own remains in use today (I have passed it down the family). Shocking when you think since 2008 I have had 2 laptops fail on me yet these devices still work perfectly. The original iPod powers up, but the battery only lasts a few minutes, and I don’t have a PC with FireWire to get songs onto it anymore</p>
<p>So just some of my iPod memories! I wonder what I’ll be using in 10 years time?</p>

      <title>I Bought an iPad</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2011/08/06/i-bought-an-ipad/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2011 19:36:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2011/08/06/i-bought-an-ipad/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been tempted by the iPad for a while now, it seemed to offer the power of a laptop without the inconvenience of a laptop. A long battery, yet always connected and always on. I knew full well about the downsides and I didn’t expect to be typing large documents on it, but for browsing the web, checking email and chatting on instant messenger it seemed perfect. So was it?</p>
<h2>Not prefect, but very good</h2>
<p>The iPad 2, despite considerably lower specs than my laptop on paper feels snappy and rarely do I have to wait for anything to happen. Unlike a laptop, there is no fan – so I feel comfortable leaving it on my bed, or on the carpet knowing I’m not to come back and find it with fans whirling while it melts. The device seems durable, whereas the iPod has a an easy-to-scratch surface, the iPad won’t get scratched under normal use.</p>
<h2>Lack of apps</h2>
<p>One thing I have found is the lack of iPad specific apps. It’s still quite a new platform, so I can forgive app developers slightly – but the big hitters such as Spotify and Audible still make you use the iPhone versions of the app, which only work in portrait mode and look pixelated. The keyboard layout is also different for iPhone apps, which is rather confusing. While I can type pretty fast on the iPad, the lack of any blogging software as good as Windows Live Writer means I still prefer to fire up my laptop to write anything substantial. An iPad version of Google Chrome would be nice, or at least a way to sync your Google Chrome bookmarks easily (it can be done now, but involves using a 3rd party service and isn’t worth the hassle in my opinion).</p>
<h2>Quality not quantity</h2>
<p>Having said all that, the apps that come with the iPad are of a very high quality. The Mail, Calendar and Contacts app are very impressive. I was surprised Apple didn’t include an alarm clock and weather app, seeing as there is one available for the iPhone but it’s not a big deal as 3rd party apps have filled the gap.</p>
<p>For casually browsing the web or responding to emails, iPad wins. Booking a holiday? Then I’ll want 30 tabs open at once, and the iPad isn’t good at context switching. Overall I am impressed, it really does fill the void between a smartphone and a laptop. Tablets won’t replace laptops in my opinion, but they will take on many of their roles relegating laptops to the more comprehensive tasks.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>So it’s nearly two years since <a href="/2009/07/08/goodbye-nokia-n95-hello-iphone/">I got my iPhone 3GS</a>, and I decided I wanted to change. Not because the old 3GS was feeling slow – it still felt snappy and the battery lasted two days. What made me change was those ever-so-annoying “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onLYKU-CNhM">if you don’t have an iPhone</a>” adverts. The thought of being associated with a brand that came across as self-obsessed and narcissistic had slowly been eating away at me, and when I read <a href="http://news.cnet.com/as-iflow-reader-app-closes-harsh-words-for-apple/8301-17938_105-20061802-1.html">this story</a>, my decision was made.</p>
<p>Compared to iOS, Android has a very “home-brewed” feel to it. The interface is much more complex and far less intuitive. On the flip side, however, that means everything is a lot more configurable. In this respect, Android reminds me more of Windows Mobile and Symbian than it does of iOS. I can schedule my work email to only push new items during work hours, for example – something I missed from my Nokia, which the iPhone did not offer. The home screen is far superior to that of the iPhone, but it falls down on simple things. Renaming a folder was surprisingly difficult to work out; it turned out I needed to click and hold on the folder name in the folder’s pop-up. Dragging widgets is awkward, as you can’t seem to have more than one floating at once, so rearranging them when the screen is full is impossible.</p>
<h2>Unlocked Doors</h2>
<p>While the software does have a “rough and ready” feel to it, this has benefits, as there is virtually no vendor lock-in. I managed to stream music from my <a href="http://www.imarc.co.uk/marcwickens/2010/03/gadget-review-iomega-nas-media-server/">DLNA NAS</a> box quite easily. Apple will let you do this, but only within their ecosystem. There is free satnav (although the phone doesn’t come with a car kit), voice input, and a whole host of good-quality apps available from the app store. One really useful feature is HTC Sense Online, which lets you locate your phone, make it ring, and lock it remotely – great when you think you may have lost it.</p>
<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<p>I am disappointed with the battery life. My iPhone (when new) would be at about 70% at 5:30 pm when I left work, with average use. The Desire S was at about 40%. It is doing a lot more, however, and just proves how little battery technology has improved in the last few years.</p>
<p>Part 2 of the review to come soon.</p>
<p>Having used the phone for over a month now (nearly two), I have a good idea of what I think of it and how it compares to the iPhone.</p>
<h2>User Experience</h2>
<p>The user experience is nowhere near as good as the iPhone. A good example of this is when I enter the contacts app and press the <em>Search</em> key. The search field does not automatically get focus, so I have to tap at the top of the screen (having just pressed the search key at the bottom), and then move back down again to begin typing. It feels awkward and unpolished.</p>
<p>Then there are the bundled apps. Like a new laptop, the phone came bundled with lots of OEM crapware. It seems HTC want me to use <em>their</em> Twitter client, and there’s no way to delete it (or even remove the icon). What is it with hardware manufacturers trying to be software companies? Just like those pointless Wi-Fi utilities or launcher bars that the likes of Acer and HP used to bundle with their laptops (HP even made their own Media Centre – the Me Too Edition).</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s a small annoyance, but the abundance of icons is likely to confuse many people.</p>
<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<p>The battery life is abysmal. It will last a day if you don’t use it much, but if you use it frequently, you’ll need to carry a charger with you. The iPhone wasn’t great, but its battery would always last a day and still have plenty left over.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is the price you pay for carrying a much more powerful device in your pocket, one that can actually multitask. (The iPhone currently just pretends to, except for a few limited tasks.) Once you get used to that, I think it would be hard to go back to a single-tasking system. Being able to have the phone download new podcasts automatically every night and update Google Reader on schedule is a breath of fresh air for anyone who used to do that five years ago on their Symbian or PocketPC-based phone – and then, like me, switched to the iPhone when it became the big thing.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to improve battery life. The best is to turn off background data, which rather defeats the purpose of having such a phone, but it’s nice to know you could, in theory, get a couple of days out of it if needed. Great if you ever go camping at a festival (although the camera also drains the battery quite a lot).</p>
<h2>Missing iOS?</h2>
<p>For all its UX faults, I prefer Android. Want Wi-Fi music sync? <a href="http://www.winamp.com/android">There’s an app for that</a>. Free satnav? <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/navigation/">There’s an app for that</a>. Tethering over Wi-Fi? <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/13/android-2-2-froyo-to-include-usb-tethering-wifi-hotspot-funct/">There’s an app for that</a>. Want to download the latest albums? Guess what, <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.amazon.mp3" title="Amazon MP3">you can do that too</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s an app for almost everything available on the iPhone, and the Android version is usually less restricted and cheaper. The exception here is games, but I’ve still found a number of quality gems – just fewer of the big names.</p>
<p>So I can’t say I miss iOS much, except for the eye candy. Maybe iOS 5 will sway me next time.</p>
<p>A highly recommended phone.</p>

      <title>Does Microsoft Have a Virtualisation Trick Up It’s Sleeve for Windows 8?</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>So Windows 8 will be all things do all people, a tablet operating system to rival iOS and Android for consuming content, while at the same time a fully functional desktop operating system that we use to create content. Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>How can that be possible? Can you imagine the iPad having 10 hours of battery life if it had to run all the background processes (and crapware) that comes preinstalled on most PCs? Bloated AntiVirus software, scheduled disk clean-ups, random Adobe icons, it can be a bit unwieldy for a system that is suppose to be “always on” – the iPad will after all, receive notifications while in standby (and yes the 10 hours is actual usage, not standby). I can’t see Windows doing that, and even with specially tuned hardware all it takes is for someone to install a bit of rouge “classic” software (rather than software using the new JavaScript and probably Silverlight APIs) and that all gets thrown out the Window (sorry, bad pun).</p>
<p>So maybe Microsoft has taken the technology it developed for Windows 7’s “XP Mode” and made it so when you buy a tablet PC, the classic side of the system that can run all your old software is completely virtualised. This would mean the entire legacy system would be contained within a single process that could be paused to save battery.</p>
<p>When installed on a desktop, this extra layer probably wouldn’t be needed (Obviously games and other high-end software won’t run well in a virtualised environment) – but for a tablet I think it makes sense.</p>
<p>Obviously this is just pure speculation on my part, so lets hope all will be revealed at this year’s <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">BUILD conference</a>.</p>

      <title>The Painted Man by Peter V Brett</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I don’t usually read fantasy books; in fact, before I read <em>The Painted Man</em>, I had never read a fantasy book. Not that I am one for boxing things into genres – I am far more likely to pick up a book based on the merit of its author’s previous work or by reading reviews. Luckily, my brother recommended this book to me, so I took it on holiday to Greece. Having just finished Stephen King’s <em>Salem’s Lot</em>, the pace and style of this book were difficult to get used to. However, once you get going, this book comes into its own. The author takes his time to build a realistic, plausible world, one plagued by monsters that arise from the core of the Earth whenever the sun sets.</p>
<p>The story follows three characters over a number of years, and by the time the narrative climaxes, you truly feel as though you are inside their heads, fully empathising with them and their actions. Along the way, there is, of course, plenty of action, heartbreak, and surprises – but what really makes this book so compelling is the fascinating world it exists in and the characters that inhabit it.</p>
<p>I was sad when I finished this book, not because the ending was bad (it isn’t) but because I knew I would be leaving that world behind. Luckily, there is a second book, and I’ve just started it. So far, so good.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book.</p>

      <title>Iomega NAS Media Server Review</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2010/03/11/from-the-archive-iomega-nas-media-server-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2010 17:39:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2010/03/11/from-the-archive-iomega-nas-media-server-review/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iomega-nas.png?w=244" alt=""></p>
<p>I have a lot of media on my various computers: music, photos, videos, and the like, but I’ve never found a satisfactory way of storing them all. My solution was to put them on my main laptop, which has a large hard disk, and then share the folders to my other laptop and Xbox 360. This is fine, except I tend to reformat my laptop quite often, and I don’t keep it on all the time at a desk. Instead, it’s packed away in its bag when not in use, making playing some music from my Xbox a bit of a hassle. So I decided a NAS box was what I needed. My only consideration really was price; I really don’t care about speed since most of the time I’ll be using 802.11g to access the files, and so the Iomega 1TB drive is what I picked. It cost £120 from PC World, which I thought was good value. I’d read a few reviews, but since those reviews, Iomega has released a new firmware (which came preinstalled on mine), and so a lot of the drawbacks have been addressed.</p>
<p>I have to say, I am very impressed. The drive is fully accessible via SMB, meaning the software that comes with the drive is not essential (I only needed to install it once to find out what IP address my DHCP server had assigned it). The drive is actually a very small computer (probably running Linux, though I can’t be sure), and so it offers extra functionality. So-called “Live Folders” allow you to create a folder that’s contents get uploaded to Facebook, YouTube, or resized, for example. The NAS box can also act as a BitTorrent client, but unfortunately, it can’t be set to download a large file over FTP/HTTP. The device is also an iTunes server as well as a DLNA server (this is an open standard that the Xbox 360 uses to stream music and video over a LAN). If only TV shows purchased from iTunes didn’t have DRM, I’d buy a few, since being able to download a series of 24 straight to this device and watch it on my Xbox would be amazing. Still, having all your media always available via Media Centre/Xbox/iTunes is great.</p>
<p>The downsides to this device are that the hard disk appears to be FAT32 (according to another review I read) – this means it’s not journaled and in the event of a power cut, the drive/data could be corrupted. There is only one hard disk, and 1TB of data is a LOT of data to be held at the whim of someone spilling something on it or a cat knocking it over, so I will still be keeping the stuff I value most in two places. Anyone wanting a proper backup solution rather than a media server solution would be wise to get something that has RAID. It’s also quite noisy and doesn’t spin down the hard disk when it’s not in use.</p>
<p>Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend this media server to others looking for a good value solution.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>I found the following information in the manual that states the drive actually uses the XFS file system, which was one of the first journaled file systems. Hooray!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Home Media Drive shares files using the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol and stores its files on XFS (built-in), FAT32 (external), and NTFS (external) hard drives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t mention this before, but you can also plug in a USB drive and share it, or you can plug in a USB printer and then share that instead. Shame there’s no SSH access, however. :)</p>

      <title>Goodbye Nokia N95, Hello iPhone</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2009/07/08/goodbye-nokia-n95-hello-iphone/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2009 20:14:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2009/07/08/goodbye-nokia-n95-hello-iphone/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For the past two years, I’ve been using the Nokia N95. At the time of its release, it was revolutionary. Even today, it holds its own when compared to the majority of phones on the market. From a top-quality camera with flash and autofocus, a GPS receiver and built-in sat-nav, DVD-quality video recording, to the more gimmicky two-way slider, the N95 really is the bee’s knees.</p>
<p>However, it was time for an upgrade. I seriously contemplated sticking with T-Mobile and the N95, perhaps switching to a cheaper tariff. But the N95’s biggest flaw let me down: build quality. My first N95 had a loose keypad, and the volume-up button broke. After about 20 months, the volume-up button broke on my second handset as well. A quick Google search reveals it’s a common fault. Whereas Nokias were once virtually indestructible (think 3310), the N95 was a fragile ornament. Other aspects of the N95 began to bug me too. The upper keypad is too cramped, making it easy to accidentally exit an application when trying to press the ‘C’ key. Application start-up times are also slow; nothing feels seamless. I decided I needed a new phone.</p>
<p>I was torn between the iPhone and the N97. After the disappointing build quality of the N95, I swore never to return to Nokia, which is a big deal for me. I’ve owned the 3330, 3510i, 6630, 6100, and 6230i – and of course the N95 – since 2001. I tried out the N97, and it looks amazing. The camera is top-notch, and it feels a lot more solid than the N95. However, the touchscreen is very poor. Like the 5800, it’s resistive, which means it works on pressure, making it a real chore to use. The UI isn’t designed for touch but rather adapted for it, and poorly in my opinion. Still, the slide-out keyboard and integrated flash in the browser were tempting enough to keep me interested. Yet, I decided to stick to my guns and not risk another N95 disappointment. I opted for the iPhone.</p>
<p>I’ve had many iPods before. I hate iTunes – it’s a prime example of bloatware. I’ve been using iTunes since 2001 when it was version 1 and came with Mac OS 9, so I have a lot of experience with it. From about version 6 onwards, it became painfully slow. On Windows, it has an annoying bug where it steals focus every few minutes, which can be fixed by adjusting Windows Live Messenger not to display your song information. I’m sure Apple makes iTunes run as slowly as possible on Windows to make Microsoft look bad. Why on earth does QuickTime, a mediocre media player that no one ever runs (except as a plug-in), need a notification icon? What exactly is it notifying me of? Anyway, we all know iTunes sucks, but for syncing music and downloading podcasts, it does the job adequately.</p>
<p>The iPhone, like the N97, looks great. However, unlike the N97, it’s not immediately obvious where the SIM card goes, so be sure to read the manual or, as I did, Google it. The screen is capacitive, meaning it works by conducting electricity from your finger. It’s much smoother and more enjoyable to use. The browser and email are excellent, but I do miss a few features of my N95.</p>
<p>Firstly, the calendar. An iPhone will only let you set a reminder for two days before an event. This is no good for something like a car service or a big birthday, where you might want a reminder a week or so in advance. It seems like a pointless limitation or oversight to me.</p>
<p>Secondly, Bluetooth. The iPhone might as well not have Bluetooth, as you can’t send photos or contacts using it. I understand Apple restricting music, but why limit photos, contacts, and calendar entries? These are basics, Apple, and you’ve got them wrong.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can’t download podcasts over 10MB or use the iPhone as a modem – the N95 could do both. The N95 was a phone, not a marketing tool for O2.</p>
<p>Thirdly, 3G reception seems poor compared to other phones on the same network in the same room.</p>
<p>The camera is bad. Even the newer 3GS, which I have, is subpar and lacks a flash.</p>
<p>I don’t want to sound entirely negative – the iPhone is a worthy upgrade from the N95. Email is much quicker and supports HTML (though Apple limits you to sending five photos as attachments), and it also syncs emails and calendars with Exchange. The N95 would take about 30 seconds to ‘think about’ my emails after receiving them, which was just plain annoying. Direct uploads to YouTube, along with some great games and applications, put the iPhone ahead of Nokia. Facebook, Twitter, even Windows Live Messenger via push (although the developer notes that the application is under review by Apple, likely because it might affect network revenues) all work seamlessly. The interface is a pleasure to use.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m glad I upgraded – though I do miss a few key features!</p>

      <title>My Review of the Nokia 6630</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2004/09/30/from-the-archives-my-review-of-the-nokia-6630/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2004 16:13:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2004/09/30/from-the-archives-my-review-of-the-nokia-6630/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060504060032/http://www.imarc.co.uk:80/2006/nokia_6630review.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/nokia-6630-593.png?w=162" alt=""></p>
<p>The Nokia 6630 is Nokia's latest smartphone offering with a 1.3 megapixel camera, 10mb of internal memory, a 200mhz processor, Bluetooth, 3G, stereo MP3/ACC playback and the latest Symbian operating system, version 8a.</p>
<p>The basic functions work well, the processor is the fastest yet to be used in a Nokia phone, and makes the menu lags and photo delays that dogged many previous Symbian based phones a thing of the past. The fast processor does take its toll on battery life however, with the average battery time with Bluetooth switched on with moderate usage of the phone about 2 days. My old Nokia 6100 lasted about 4 days, so this short time is by and large the biggest shock to me, but its not as bad as it sounds. This is a smartphone running many processes at a time and so battery life was always going to be an issue. The 6100 was a series 40 Nokia that didn't do much at all. It's a case of features vs. battery life, and since I am don't need to take this phone out in the wilderness for days at a time without mains power access, the 2 day battery time is not a problem.</p>
<p>Texting is a joy on this phone, the keypad is small yet responsive enough to text very quickly. The screen is so large that you can fit a whole text message on the screen without the need for scrolling, and of course with 10mb of memory there's plenty of room for hundreds of text messages, and multimedia messages. The messaging application also has a POP3 and IMAP client, which is flawed because it doesn't let users choose any port to connect on - such a basic concept and Nokia have left it out. So unless your ISP uses the standard ports for email (Gmail don't!), this will be of no use to you. Other email applications can be installed, but many of them cost money.</p>
<p>Making calls on the phone is also easily done, just like any Nokia in fact. The loud speaker isn't as loud as I'd have liked, but it does the job and I seldom use it anyway. The phone, being a 3G phone also supports Video calls - in my opinion the stupidest idea ever, why would I want to pay over the odds to see the person I'm calling when I can just hear them? For those that do see a use for this, and can afford it - the phone makes it easy, when you select call a menu pops up allowing you to select phone or video call. There's no camera on the front, so in order for the other person to see you you need to connect the phone to the stand, which comes in the box. Not exactly video on the move, but adding another camera to the front would just add to the bulk and Nokia have obviously realised that hardly anyone wants to use this feature anyway.</p>
<p>The camera on this phone is brilliant. It can take photos at an amazing quality, but its such a shame there's only 10mb of internal memory. This trivial amount of memory is simply not proportionate to the other great specifications of the phone. The video recorder also captures sound, and can record for up to an hour if you have a big enough memory card. The phone takes dual voltage reduced-size multimedia cards. Why couldn't it just take standard MMC cards? Is it a plot by the memory card manufactures to make people like me who already own an assortment of memory cards go out and buy more? The reduced-size card comes with an adaptor that is suppose to make the card fit into a standard MMC slot in a card reader. IT DOESN'T WORK. Mine doesn't anyway, and so I've had to use the data able that came with the phone to access the phone's memory and the card. The phone comes with a 32mb card, enough for about 8 music files at a decent quality.</p>
<p>MP3 playback is average and no way near as good as my PocketPC. Vodafone decided to restrict the phone so you can't set MP3s as ringtones. Luckily you can set AAC files as ringtones, AAC is Apple's music format and you can create AAC files using iTunes. Music playback also drains the battery big time, but its good enough if you don't want to be carrying a phone and an MP3 player all the time. Playing music for about 4 hours a day made the battery last about a day and a half. I've used it extensively with the supplied headphones (which also double as a hands-free kit) and found them to be lacking in base, I think this is not because the speakers are no good, but because there's no equaliser on the phone.</p>
<p>Browsing the web is also a joy on this piece of equipment, the large screen and Opera web browser make it a easy and fun The 3G speed is also blindingly fast, and with a free program called Agile Messenger, MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ can all be used on the move. Watch out however, 3G is stupidly expensive. The fast speed simply means you spend more in less time, so I'd advice anyone to switch off images on the browser to save them selves money. One day maybe we'll get mobile data at a decent price, but Vodafone charge a whopping £2.75 per megabyte!! Daylight robbery, but fair enough they did give me this £400 phone for free on a £33/ month contract which is a pretty good deal.</p>
<p>Word and Excel file can be viewed on this phone using the built in QuickOffice applications, there's also a first-rate image viewer that displays images in a rotating wheel format, or as a slideshow with fade-in animations. This is useful for showing your mates a collection of photos in full-screen. There's also a photo editor, where photos can be cropped and borders added to them. Its quite difficult to use, and I think I'll stick to sending photos to my PDA via Bluetooth, and editing them on the PocketPC - some tasks are just easier with a mouse or stylus. Then there's a video editor, videos captured can be slowed down (good for photo finishes) and background music can be set (disappointingly not any music file, only MIDI files). You can probably do more, I haven't had a chance to play with this application much yet.</p>
<p>Overall: A very impressive phone with nearly every feature I could want.</p>

      <title>HP iPaq 2200 Review</title>
      <link>https://imarc.co.uk/2004/04/30/hp-ipaq-2200-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2004 17:12:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://imarc.co.uk/2004/04/30/hp-ipaq-2200-review/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ipaq2200.jpeg?w=103" alt=""></p>
<p>At £279 this PDA seemed too good to be true. It has 56MB of usable internal memory, a compact flash slot and secure digital slot. It also has Bluetooth, infrared, backlight and a replaceable battery that lasts about 8 hours, depending on usage and backlight brightness.</p>
<p>Out of the box you get everything you need, except one thing, which I’ll come to later. If like me you decide to buy from Dixon’s and take advantage of the “buy now, pay in 9 months” option be aware that SD cards and CF cards are sold at much lower prices on Amazon.co.uk – although at £279 you need to spend over £300 to use the “buy now, pay in 9 months” option. If you don’t want to pay later, then the PDA is also available cheaply online.</p>
<p>The 2200 is a good size, with a brilliant screen. If you have a digital camera that takes either SD cards or CF cards, then you will find much use for this PDA as you can view your photos on a much larger screen than most cameras, crop photos, adjust brightness and contrast, and even email your photos – without even stepping near a proper PC. The small size and lightweight can be a disadvantage. Coming from a Palm m105, I was used to having a PDA with a built in screen protector. The iPaq has no such thing, the screen is exposed much of the time like that of a phone. A soft case included does partially solve this issue, but it is no way near as convenient as the flip-top my Palm m105 had. It’s annoying when using the iPaq as an MP3 player when you want to skip songs on the move.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pocketpc2003.jpg?w=480" alt=""></p>
<p>The build quality of the device seems good, however the 5 way directional button does pop-out on times (it has been made removable for cleaning purposes) and the rubber side grips seems to peel off within a month – THIS IS A BIG ISSUE! Many users have reported this problem, which is why I suggest HP include some superglue in the box, as that seems to do the trick. Having said that, the battery door seems very secure, the CF and SD slots are well built, even if it is all too easy to eject the SD card while pushing the device into your pocket. I guess having a door would have made the device bigger, so I can’t really complain there. The 5 other buttons seem solid. The software included is very good.</p>
<p>You get Outlook 2003 for your PC, and Outlook for your iPaq. This consists of Address book, Inbox, Tasks and Notes. Pocket Word and Pocket Excel are also included. Pocket Word really is nothing special, more a glorified notepad application than a word processor. It has basic RTF formatting but no images sadly; I don’t see why support for images has been omitted. Maybe because Microsoft need some sort of reason for people to upgrade to the next version, other than a few new icons like we seem to get on the desktop counterparts. Excel however does have what you’d expect, since images aren’t really needed in a spreadsheet the fact that again they are not supported doesn’t matter. Viewing large sheets can be awkward, when the start bar, toolbar and input panel are being used – luckily there is a full screen option. Windows Media Player Mobile edition is also included, and it does a fine job of playing back MP3 and WMA. Windows Media Videos are also supported, but there’s no support for rival formats like .mov, which is a shame since most other mobile devices (cameras, phones etc) seem to record in the QuickTime format. Still, rivals will be rivals but it happens to be a shame. Perhaps the best bit of included software is ‘nevo’. A universal remote control. Have fun switching off TVs in shops that have them at the front showing CCTV footage. Apart from that obvious use, you can control your video, DVD, stereo, projector, lights – in fact anything that supports infrared control. What Nevo doesn’t know, Nevo can learn from the existing remote control.</p>
<p>Getting online is easy too. That’s if you have a Bluetooth phone with a modem, an infrared phone with a modem, or a WiFi CF Card. You can easily send and receive email, as long as your ISP allows you to use their SMTP server from other networks (assuming you use a different ISP on your phone than you do on your PC). For some stupid reason, the Inbox application can’t have different usernames and passwords set for POP3 and SMTP – they have to be the same. The web browser (Internet Explorer) is great, and thankfully has an option to switch off images – because GPRS costs a lot, and I easily spent £5 in one session. MSN is a good addition, and integrates well into the OS when you place it in the background. The operating system itself is a typical Microsoft affair and resembles early versions of Mac OS. With a main menu in the top right. Sometimes you get “OK” in a window at the top right title bar, other times it’s a command button on the actual form. Standardisation on issues like this would be good. Having said that, I did make a conscious decision to choose PocketPC over Palm because it has better multitasking abilities, and better built in software.</p>
<p>Switching between tasks is badly done; the iTask application is inconvenient, having to press a hardware button to bring up a list of tasks. Instead I use a 3rd party program called Magic Button, which is far better.</p>
<p>Overall, a good buy. The dictaphone facilities, mobile net access and music features have come in handy, so much so that my iPod hasn’t been used since I got the PDA. Well worth the money. As after all this is a <em>Pocket PC</em>.</p>

      <title>Netscape 6 Review</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I started off by downloading the installer, and after about 1 hour, it crashed and failed to resume. So I waited for it to appear on the .net cover disc, and to my excitement, on the 22nd of December 2000 I received issue 80 of .net and installed Netscape 6.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2000/12/installing-netscape-6.png" alt="installing netscape 6"></p>
<p>First impressions were OK, at least the installer had worked. The only thing I use communicator for really is to browse newsgroups, and so the first thing I tried was to connect the password protected server I use. Now NS4 didn’t remember my password every session, that was livable, NS6 however can’t even remember it within 1 session, every time I changed group or composed a message I was asked to re-enter my password. Maybe fiddling around in the settings could solve this, but at the speed which NS6 functions, looking around the settings dialogue is a chore. Browsing the web in NS6 was slow and many sites didn’t appear correctly, and please Netscape, for the last time – I DON’T want to join Netcenter!!</p>
<p>So overall, I’m completely unhappy with Netscape 6, it may look nice, but it’s slow and bug-ridden.</p>
<p>Compare it to Internet Explorer and there’s no competition. Internet Explorer works, it works fast, and doesn’t have (as many) annoying bugs. People mock Microsoft for the occasional bug and security hitch, but don’t seem to act the same way with companies like Netscape release a program like this. Netscape is a tacky,  poor quality, below standard web browser suit,  even if it was bundled with Windows sixty times over, I would never use it. Internet Explore works, and I’ll be sticking with my current set of applications: IE5 for web browsing, Eudora for email and Netscape 4 for newsgroups.</p>
