<p>Having become a semi-regular commuter to London, I’ve found that the various well-known apps for checking train times are all terrible. There isn’t an app where you can simply say: h<em>ere is my regular commute; I just need to know the next train, which platform it’s on, and whether it’s delayed.</em>
TheTrainLine is arguably focused on planning journeys, and the National Rail app is just plain awful, especially in areas with poor signal.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://trntxt.uk"><strong>trntxt.uk</strong></a>. It’s a simple website that lets you enter your starting station and destination, generating a unique URL you can bookmark or add to your phone’s home screen. You can instantly see the next train, its duration (helpful for avoiding the slow ones), its ETA, and the platform. It’s perfect for commuters — and it’s free.</p>
