  <h1>Another SharePoint Security Flaw</h1>
  <p class="meta">25 Jul 2025</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/microsoft-sharepoint-attack-now-sees-victim-count-rises-to-400-organizations-including-us-nuclear-agency">Ellen Jennings-Trace writing for Tech Radar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New estimates regarding the recently-exploited Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities now evaluate that as many as 400 organizations may have been targeted.</p>
<p>The figure is a sharp increase from the original count of around 100, with Microsoft pointing the finger at Chinese threat actors for the hacks, namely Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603.</p>
<p>The victims are primarily US based, and amongst these are some high value targets, including the National Nuclear Security Administration - the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing nuclear weapons, Bloomberg reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/">makes it clear</a> this is an issue with on-prem instances of SharePoint, not the cloud based Office 365 solution.</p>
<p>One might question why an organisation would choose to run these services on premises in 2025. In my experience, banks and other security-focused institutions often believe their own teams can outperform Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud or AWS. Yet <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/guidance-for-responders-investigating-and-remediating-on-premises-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">time and time again</a>, we see on-prem is actually less secure than the cloud. Unless your service is complelty air-locked from the Internet, I see very few reasons to be relying on on-premisis software, especially Microsoft products, in 2025.</p>
<p>Hopefully, running on-premises commercial services like this in the name of security will soon be consigned to the trash can of computing history, along with other <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry">security theatre</a> measures often imposed by IT administrators, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/set-password-expiration-policy?view=o365-worldwide&amp;">enforced password expiries</a>.</p>
