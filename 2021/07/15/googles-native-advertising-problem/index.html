  <h1>Google’s Native Advertising Problem</h1>
  <p class="meta">15 Jul 2021</p>
  <p>I've noticed that Google's search results are full of a lot more spam recently. When I scroll past the page of ads that Google itself places at the top of the results page and jump straight to the so called 'organic' search results, I find more than more that these links turn out to be nothing more than thinly veiled advertisements themselves.</p>
<p>In one example, after finding out my new router supports connecting my entire network to a VPN, I searched Google for the model name and the word '<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=fritzbox+vpn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">VPN</a>&quot;. The second result was an article that was quick point out that my router doesn't support Express VPN, but I should probably just use it anyway. There was of course a big fat button linking to Express VPN. Using the excellent <a href="https://wheregoes.com/trace/20215089724/">wheregoes.com</a> I was quickly able to verify that yes, this was a referral link. This article exists for no other reason than to make money from confused users.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/expressvpn_spam.png?w=946" alt=""></p>
<p>Minutes later I searched for how to synchronise to Macs without using iCloud. The 2nd result was <a href="https://macpaw.com/how-to/sync-two-macs">this page</a> by MacPaw.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macpaw-search-spam.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>The article has runs through some rudimentary waffle about how cloud synchronisation works, and then about halfway down the pages suddenly breaks into an advert for their product &quot;CleanMyMac X&quot;. An app that is completely unrelated to file synchronisation.</p>

<p>While I've nothing against so called &quot;inbound marketing&quot; articles, they can often have genuine value (Digital Ocean's vast array of tutorials for configuring Linux servers are some of the best on the web), it's clear that Google has a big problem on its hand in distinguishing the cruft from the genuinely useful content.</p>
