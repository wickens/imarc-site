<p>Riccardo Mori has written <a href="http://morrick.me/archives/9150">a thoroughly enjoyable critique</a> of the the latest macOS user interface design. This passage in particular made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mac’s user interface is undergoing plastic surgery by the hand of surgeons who have studied on iOS books. The result is pretty much the same as when you see a favourite celebrity after a procedure. They look ‘younger’ but there’s also something weird about their appearance. Their traits have changed a bit. In certain cases you almost fail to recognise the person at first glance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've not upgraded my aging 2013 MacBook Air just yet, but I've experienced Big Sur when briefly using my girlfriend's laptop. I agree there is something that feels slightly 'off' about the new design. Even small details, like the fact that the new control centre glyph looks like a set of miniature switches - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/buttons/switches/">which are a UI components themselves</a>. Whether the new UI will grown on me as iOS 7's did (I was an iOS 6 holdout for many months) will depend on how much Apple refine the new look over the coming months a years, as they did with iOS. Perhaps my <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/22/macos-big-finger/">theory</a> will one day hold true, that Big Sur's big surprise is that it will support touch screens after all.</p>
<p>My fondest memories of Mac OS X was probably Puma. This was a free updated related after 10.0's abysmal stability and performance problems. I remember picking it up for free from John Lewis. (In lieu of an Apple Store - there were none in the UK at the time - they were the one of the few places to get such things.) Back then Mac OS X seemed like a new frontier in user interface design. Here is what 16 year old me's desktop looked like in 2002:</p>
