The Fitness app in 2016 vs 2021

Lee asks _[Are Apple ruining user experience to promote their own services?](https://ljpuk.net/2021/02/04/are-apple-ruining-user-experience-to-promote-their-own-services/)_ - While using the Fitness app earlier today it occurred to me that the answer is most definitely _yes!_ The current incarnation of the Fitness app (formally known as Activity) now squashes in _Activity History_, _current day_, _workout lists_, _awards_, and the recently added _trends_ functionality into a single tab. Only _Sharing_ and their brand new premium service, _Fitness+_ get their own tab, and the cynic in me thinks even _Sharing_ is only there because it helps sell Apple Watches to friends and family.

Really, Fitness+ should be its own app, but that would make it easy to delete and forget about. Instead, Apple who were once leaders in user interface design (so much that they call it _human interface_), are using an entire tab (one whole third of the total tabs) to show a service many people (I'd wager _most_) won't use. The original app was a joy to use, but the latest one just feels crowded. I hope Apple can find a way to promote services without lowering their famous user experience standards.
