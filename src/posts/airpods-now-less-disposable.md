An Apple announcement from WWDC 2020:

> To reduce battery aging, AirPods learn from your daily charging routine so they can wait to finish charging past 80% until you need to use them

I have long speculated that the reason AirPods are much more [disposable](https://imarc.me/2020/03/05/airpods-pro/) when compared to other Bluetooth devices is that fact that their poor batteries are pretty much always in constant use. They are always either in the case **charging**, or in your ears **discharging**.

I own a pair of Plantronics wireless headphones from 2015 that have much better battery life than my AirPods which were purchased in 2016. I know there are many factors at work but the speed at which the batteries on AirPods decline is staggering. I suspect (and hope) this update will dramatically increase the longevity of AirPods.

Great work Apple.
