> In the beginning, Samsung TV owners were seeing ads for new streaming content, apps or Samsung products. Owners are now complaining about larger, increasingly obtrusive, and unrelated ads.

This is why my Samsung TV is no longer connected to the Internet. Instead, I use an Apple TV to stream media. If you can't do that, then I recommend using a Raspberry Pi and installing [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/) to block the ads. Even the cheapest model will run PiHole, and it's laughably easy to install.
