[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/23/citigroup-ceo-ordains-zoom-free-fridays-to-ease-relentless-pandemic-workday) on Citigroup banning internal video calls on Fridays::

> Global investment bank Citigroup has banned work video calls on Fridays in an attempt to help employees break free from the “relentlessness of the pandemic workday”.
> 
> Jane Fraser, Citi’s new chief executive, told staff that the last day of the working week would be known as “Zoom-free Fridays”.

This is in the context of what appears to be an unhealthy workaholic culture over at Citigroup, but it's still interesting to see more and more people coming to the view that video calls [aren't always the right form of communication](https://imarc.co.uk/2021/02/28/time-to-turn-off-video-to-avoid-online-meeting-fatigue/).

Once it is safe to go back to the office, I can see myself and others opting to go in for meetings once or twice a week, while remaining at home the rest of the time to get work done. In this world video calls become increasingly unnecessary. It also sets a clear boundary between discussing getting work done, and _actually_ getting work done, which might be quite illuminating.
