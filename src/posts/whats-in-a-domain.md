I came across [this fascinating blog post](https://medium.com/@amd_2793/my-million-dollar-domain-hobby-c74b14db4e64) about how one man and a few Ruby scripts managed to register what he estimates amounts to $1,000,000 worth of domain names. Many of the examples he [registered](https://gurge.com/domains.html) are single word domain names such as _cheese.ai_ and _crowbar.io_.

This set me wondering whether domain names _really_ matter that much these days? Obviously some people see value in them, much like some people see value in a personalised number plate for their car (Something I have never understood - but each to their own.). A memorable domain name such _moonpig.com_ or _comparethemarket.com_ is genuinely useful for people looking to find you online, whereas a bespoke vehicle number plate is there to satisfy the owner. How many successful businesses use generic, one-word domain names anyway? For a while British Gas advertised their online presence as _www.house.co.uk_, but these days it redirects to _www.britishgas.co.uk_. Clearly trying to associate a well known brand with a tangentially related word didn't work out. The exception might be offering email services: _your.name@cheese.ai_ would be pretty cool, and _hey.com_ is an obvious recent example - but again I don't think many people are that bothered about their email address these days. For my job I have to review a lot of CVs, and I'm often surprised how many people who are clearly very qualified, have been in the industry for a while, yet have an email address with _gmail.com_ or _hotmail.com_. When a domain costs around £10 a year, it seems like a no-brainer to have your own domain for professional reasons - yet most people don't.

So I've come to that conclusion that for most people domains do not matter. The web is now search-first. Gone are the days of meticulously typing _http://www.bbc.co.uk_ into your web browser and smashing down with great satisfaction on the enter key; for most people, their browser either suggests the site or a Google search does instead. If domains don't matter, maybe I should start registering random strings instead? _**mimcxsxuqibozfq.com**_ is it!
