[Benj Edwards for Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/dead-internet-theory-comes-to-life-with-new-ai-powered-social-media-app/):

> On Monday, software developer Michael Sayman launched a [new AI-populated social network app called SocialAI](https://socialai.co/) that feels like it’s bringing that conspiracy theory to life, allowing users to interact solely with AI chatbots instead of other humans. It’s available on the iPhone app store, but so far, it’s picking up pointed criticism.

A social networking app where you are the centre of the universe, surrounded by bots constantly providing you with positive reinforcement and worshipping your every word. Elon Musk must be kicking himself – he could have saved $44 billion.
