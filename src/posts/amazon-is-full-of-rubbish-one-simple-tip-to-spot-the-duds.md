Over the past few months, I’ve noticed a number of Amazon sellers using blatantly fake product shots. They’re not even trying to make them look realistic. A reverse image search reveals they’ve simply taken [stock photos](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/senior-lady-with-a-walker-gm589098146-101171691) and pasted what is presumably a real photo of their product into them, with no regard for how the angle, lighting, or shadows appear.

This must surely be the best way to tell if a product is rubbish, rather than relying on the (probably also fake) reviews.
