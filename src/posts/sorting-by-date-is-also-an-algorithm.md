It's a common refrain in tech circles when discussing Twitter to talk about "The Algorithm". Take this Lifewire article: _"[How to Turn off the Twitter Timeline Algorithm](https://web.archive.org/web/20190613224737/https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-twitter-timeline-algorithm-4174499)"_, or this one by TechCrunch: _"[Twitter makes algorithmic timeline default on iOS](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/twitter-makes-algorithmic-timeline-default-on-ios/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADCeaYUdBR1NNtjFLiP1nDMAgJItWZoj9bndqsKR3oXUleBopWE6Otoiap6zWxOEpHlPsT8fLSpym8gNJU7xqwacnEmE8WOTeVMukbNMjJxJ4ETjCKZ1pUEZ-KZtJ-lQbH2ZIgNdjmDeREqLsrdepwIqtp8vBB1dOKPDy2XQePCN)"_.

In the beginning the Twitter timeline was a simple list of posts by people you follow sorted by date descending. In 2013 Twitter introduced a new timeline that wasn't so transparent. It was seemingly designed to optimise for engagement. All of a sudden, people were seeing posts from people they didn't follow, or that were posted days ago and for some reason had been boosted by the algorithm.

The point is, both the classic timeline and the "algorithmic" timeline are both in fact _algorithmic_. In fact, the first algorithm taught in computer science is often the [Bubble Sort](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjdkw6f/revision/4) algorithm. It's still an algorithm! In the case of Twitter, or its upcoming rival Mastodon, sorting by date may be a preferable, but there are possibly downsides too. Prioritising something because it happens to have been posted recently is a form of [Recency bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias) after all. The key seems to be [transparency](https://imarc.co.uk/2020/08/05/transparency-in-ai/).

So enjoy your favourite algorithm, and remember, they're not all bad.
