It's crazy to see the British tabloids egging people on in trying and find loopholes in the UK Government's Coronavirus restrictions. A better headline would have been "_Ignore lightweight Agriculture Minister George Eustice, and keep to the spirit of the rules_. _Viruses don't care about your intent, technicalities, or what the Government says_". Then again, there's a reason why I didn't go into journalism.
