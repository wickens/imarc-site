_The right airport is a year old, the left one a few weeks._

I've had my AirPods Pro just shy of one year now. The left AirPod however was [replaced](https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/03/airpods-rapid-warranty-replacement/) a few weeks ago. I used them today for a couple of hours and noticed for the first time how much faster the battery drained on the older AirPod. 13%! What a difference a year makes. There could be other explanations of course, battery conditioning being the main one. (It is a common belief that our electronics are able to gauge how much battery power is remaining, however they cannot; they are only able to estimate how much power has been used and subtract that from the last known total capacity of the battery.) Additionally, we've only had the luxury of [smart charging](https://imarc.co.uk/2020/06/23/airpods-now-less-disposable/) since September. The degradation won't be as pronounced for people buying new AirPods today.
