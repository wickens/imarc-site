The Maximum PC site is still online to this day, as it was when it was abandoned in 2001

On the most recent episode of [ATP](https://atp.fm), John Siracusa referenced once of his early Mac OS X reviews. This prompted me to revisit his review of the Mac OS X public beta, as the evolution of computer interfaces is something that I find fascinating.

In one of his screenshots, he [shows](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/archive/mac-os-x-beta/world-view-big.jpg) the Ars Technica home page. At the top of the page is a banner informing readers that Ars is part of the "[Maximum PC Network](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/future-launches-new-uk-web-network/43662)". I immediately recalled this web site, as it was closely related to many other publications I was into at the time, including [.net magazine](https://imarc.me/2020/06/21/farewell-net-magazine/). So, I decided to see what became of the Maximum PC Network by visiting its site in 2020. I expected to find a domain for sale, or it redirecting to a parent company - but no, to my surprise, **[maximumpc.co.uk](https://maximumpc.co.uk)** is still online, and is still showing the date of when it was presumably last updated - **26th February 2001**. Complete with references to _em@il_ and asking whether _Windows XP_ is worth upgrading to, the site is straight out of 2001, but amazingly - still online. Some server, somewhere in 2020 has been left running sine 2001.

I'd love to know the story of how this has happened - how does someone forget a web site existed, but continue to pay for its hosting â€“ even going as far as renewing the SSL certificate each year? That said, I think it's great and I wish more web sites could stay online once they are abandoned.
