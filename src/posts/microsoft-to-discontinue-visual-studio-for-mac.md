In a disappointing move, Microsoft have [discontinued Visual Studio for the Mac](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/). This comes not long after they [rewrote](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2022/05/25/vs-2022-for-mac-ga.aspx) the user interface to be faster and more fluid using native frameworks. Given the depressing state of Windows these days, the lack of a full-featured IDE does not bode well for the long-term future of .NET and other related technologies. For many years, Windows has seemed stuck in limbo. Adding pointless features like Dark Mode, but still with nowhere near the number of productivity features Mac users take for granted. I had considered VS for Mac somewhat if a lifeboat for .NET developers wanting jump ship from Microsoft's [burning platform](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/feb/09/nokia-burning-platform-memo-elop).
