![apple-watch-volume-limit.PNG](/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9ce94-apple-watch-volume-limit.png) I've just discovered this, hidden away in Settings under "Sounds and Haptics" Â is a "Volume Limit" feature. I'd missed this. On the iPhone it's under Music settings, not sound. Still, I'd recommend everyone set this to 60% to avoid hearing loss when streaming music from your Apple Watch. **_Update: the latest operating systems have moved the setting to a new "[Headphone Safety](http://imarc.co.uk/2020/09/30/avoid-damaging-your-hearing-with-ios-and-watchos/)" menu._**
