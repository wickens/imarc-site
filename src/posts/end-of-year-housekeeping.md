A quick and boring housekeeping update:

I've changed the domain of this site to be _**imarc.co.uk**_. I had originally gone with _imarc.me_ when I started the site earlier this year, but over the summer I jotted down all the domains I own, their annual cost and divided that figure by 12 and realised I was spending more than I wanted to on domain names. I've had the _.co.uk_ domain since 2002 and don't plan on relinquishing it anytime soon, so I figured why not use it? Additionally, the old-school internet user in me still can't help thinking that any domain not ending in .com, .net, .org or a country TLD isn't a real domain (Readers who know their Internet history will know that _.me_ stands for Montenegro, and is actually not a [generic TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain), but it gets used like one). **_imarc.co.uk_** been home to many of my home pages before, including my own CMS at one point. Now it's home to this blog. The old _.me_ domain will eventually expire and be bought by a domain squatter, so please update your bookmarks/RSS reader. Ultimately, it's unlikely [anyone will notice](https://imarc.co.uk/2020/12/20/whats-in-a-domain/) as content is what really matters, but in my mind, the small things matter too.

Secondly, I'm retiring my old personal blog **_Lost in Logic_**. The purpose the site you are reading now was to start afresh and only post content I believe adds something to the nonstop deluge of technology commentary we find online everyday, whereas my older blog was holiday photos intermixed with album reviews with the odd gadget review thrown in. It wasn't very focused. Moving it between various web hosts over the course of 10 years also took its toll - many of the images are broken in older posts. That said, it's still fun to be able to look back so I will keep the site online at this new URL: [https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk](https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk) (I have migrated a few recent posts over to iMarc as I think they fit its theme). Some of my favourite posts were:

*   [My history in mobile phones (2000 - 2012)](https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2013/09/12/my-history-in-phones/)
*   [How basic was iOS 3?](https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2014/07/13/iphone-os-3/index.html)
*   [Florida from the sky](https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2014/02/16/some-photos-from-my-recent-trip-to-orlando-florida/index.html)
*   [10 years of the iPod](https://archive.lostinlogic.wickens.org.uk/content/2011/11/06/10-years-of-the-ipod/index.html)

Thank you for reading to the end - wishing you all the best for 2021!
