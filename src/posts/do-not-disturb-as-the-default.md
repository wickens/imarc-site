I'd really like to see mobile operating systems make less of a fuss when you have "_Do Not Disturb_" switched on. While the feature is a useful one, having a banner across the home screen, or an omnipresent icon at the top of the watch face only seeks to signify that not wanting to be disturbed is an exceptional state, not the norm. The default mode is "_Disturb Me_".

Instead, I wonder if the default should in fact be "_Do Not Disturb_" and that we should have to _choose_ when we want notifications - with options to allow close friends and family to override the setting of course. If someone outside your close circle phones outside of your "_Disturb Me_" hours, Siri could take the call and inform them of when you'll be available.
