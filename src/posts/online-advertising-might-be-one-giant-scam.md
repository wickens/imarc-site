If you listen to only one podcast this week then it should be the latest episode of [Talking Politics featuring the great documentary film-maker Adam Curtis](https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/blog/2021/314-adam-curtis). I recommend listening to the entire episode, the bit at the 29 minutes was of particular interest as he explores the modern Internet, whether online advertising can possibly work, and how peculiar it is that advertising is no longer an add-on to the economy but central to it. Curtis also likens mining 'Big Data' for hidden patterns and inferring causality to the way in which conspiracy theories work. This seems obvious in hindsight. Mind blown. If 48 minutes isn't enough, he also delves deeper into a lot of the material covered in the podcast in his new BBC documentary series [Canâ€™t Get You Out of My Head](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p093wp6h/cant-get-you-out-of-my-head), which I also thoroughly recommend.
