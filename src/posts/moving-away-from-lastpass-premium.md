LastPass made headlines recently because it's stripping back its free offering and asking users to pay for features that were once bundled for free.

I've been a paid LastPass subscriber for over 5 years, and over that time it has become a critical part of both my professional and home workflows. The problem is the issues it had 5 years ago are still problems now. The product seemingly hasn't moved forward much at all. LastPass has a fundamental misunderstanding of basic User Interface design principals. It looks awful and is difficult to use. Each app behaves differently on different platforms, and features are shoehorned in with little regard to the expected user workflow. How many times have I searched for a site, copied the username, only to have to _search for the site again_ in order to copy the password. Errors are frequent, when generating a new password I always end up pasting it into a text editor temporarily in case LastPass fails to save it. It's also incredibly slow, even on 2020 Intel i5 processor.

I mention this because I recently helped a friend migrate from LastPass's free offering to Apple's iCloud Keychain. Compared so LastPass, iCloud is so much _nicer_ to user. I understand LastPass are at a disadvantage in trying to make their product fit into the ecosystems of Apple and Google, but it made me think about switching. Now Apple have made an official way to access [iCloud passwords on Windows](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/icloud/mmfeee20145e/1.0/icloud/1.0), I'm seriously thinking about switching. To their credit LastPass do make it easy to get a CSV export of all your data.

What's your experience with iCloud Keychain? Is it worth switching to from LastPass Premium?
