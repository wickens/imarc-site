The view looking north towards Reading as the Odiham Road meets the Basingstoke Road. In the far left you can see The Bull, while on the right is the Bear Inn. The year is currently unknown.

In the first photo, The Bear Inn is now M Woods' Coal Merchant. In the second photo from 2022 you can just about make out the Bull on the far left.

## Bull Lane

If you look closely at the cottage on the left, you can see the same window (left, middle).

[Wayside Stores](https://www.genealogy.com/ftm/b/r/a/David-I-Branchett/index.html) would later become an ice cream shop.

Next to Copse House was a beautiful cottage named Petroli. This photo from 1987 shows it in a state of disrepair. It was later replaced with two houses.

Into the 1940s. Notice on the sign that the word 'Riseley' has been covered up. Presumably this was to avoid helping any German bombers or a potential invading force with navigation.

## About This Site

This site is maintained by [Marc Wickens](https://marc.wickens.org.uk/). The materials were left to me by my Grandmother, **Barbara Baker**, who conducted a research project on the history of Swallowfield and Riseley. There are many, many more images and details that I plan to add here in the future.

If you can help date any of the images, have any to share, or would like to notify me of any errors, please get in touch. 

Modifications: Some of the images have been colourised using machine learning. For images that were originally postcards I have also removed location text from the image itself.
