Various personal project I've worked on in my spare time:

 1. [Riseley History](/riseley/) – Old photos of the village in which I grew up in.
 2. [Podcast Archive](https://github.com/wickens/PodcastArchive) – Tool for downloading and archiving episodes of a podcast.
 3. [Lost In Logic](https://www.lostinlogic.com/) – My old blog, though I've posted most of the good stuff over.
