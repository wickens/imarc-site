<p>The Maximum PC site is still online to this day, as it was when it was abandoned in 2001</p>
<p>On the most recent episode of <a href="https://atp.fm">ATP</a>, John Siracusa referenced once of his early Mac OS X reviews. This prompted me to revisit his review of the Mac OS X public beta, as the evolution of computer interfaces is something that I find fascinating.</p>
<p>In one of his screenshots, he <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/archive/mac-os-x-beta/world-view-big.jpg">shows</a> the Ars Technica home page. At the top of the page is a banner informing readers that Ars is part of the &quot;<a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/future-launches-new-uk-web-network/43662">Maximum PC Network</a>&quot;. I immediately recalled this web site, as it was closely related to many other publications I was into at the time, including <a href="https://imarc.me/2020/06/21/farewell-net-magazine/">.net magazine</a>. So, I decided to see what became of the Maximum PC Network by visiting its site in 2020. I expected to find a domain for sale, or it redirecting to a parent company - but no, to my surprise, <strong><a href="https://maximumpc.co.uk">maximumpc.co.uk</a></strong> is still online, and is still showing the date of when it was presumably last updated - <strong>26th February 2001</strong>. Complete with references to <em>em@il</em> and asking whether <em>Windows XP</em> is worth upgrading to, the site is straight out of 2001, but amazingly - still online. Some server, somewhere in 2020 has been left running sine 2001.</p>
<p>I'd love to know the story of how this has happened - how does someone forget a web site existed, but continue to pay for its hosting – even going as far as renewing the SSL certificate each year? That said, I think it's great and I wish more web sites could stay online once they are abandoned.</p>
