  <h1>Is That Recommended Song an Advertisement?</h1>
  <p class="meta">14 Nov 2020</p>
  <p>In what seems to been an inevitable move in the march of awfulness that is much of the tech industry these days, Spotify has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/">announced</a> that it will be giving artists who pay for the privilege a boost in the algorithm that recommends music to its customers.</p>
<p>For many, especially those who listen to commercial radio, this is probably nothing new. The idea of a record label paying to get their acts in front of more listeners is a pretty standard affair. However, the idea these ads might be sold to customers as a personalised recommendations seems creepy to me. I hope they are clearly labelled as ads, even if the artist having paid for promotion is only one of many inputs into the algorithm that ultimately produces the recommendation.</p>
<p>I never really got on with Spotify's user interface, but I do use Apple Music due to its Siri and Apple Watch integration. The recommendations seem to be very US centric and can be very hit and miss. I've found a couple of new artists via Apple Music, but mostly I find most of my new music via <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_6music">6 Music</a>. I can't see Apple selling out like this.</p>
