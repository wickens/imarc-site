  <h1>What’s in a Domain?</h1>
  <p class="meta">20 Dec 2020</p>
  <p>I came across <a href="https://medium.com/@amd_2793/my-million-dollar-domain-hobby-c74b14db4e64">this fascinating blog post</a> about how one man and a few Ruby scripts managed to register what he estimates amounts to $1,000,000 worth of domain names. Many of the examples he <a href="https://gurge.com/domains.html">registered</a> are single word domain names such as <em><a href="http://cheese.ai">cheese.ai</a></em> and <em><a href="http://crowbar.io">crowbar.io</a></em>.</p>
<p>This set me wondering whether domain names <em>really</em> matter that much these days? Obviously some people see value in them, much like some people see value in a personalised number plate for their car (Something I have never understood - but each to their own.). A memorable domain name such <em><a href="http://moonpig.com">moonpig.com</a></em> or <em><a href="http://comparethemarket.com">comparethemarket.com</a></em> is genuinely useful for people looking to find you online, whereas a bespoke vehicle number plate is there to satisfy the owner. How many successful businesses use generic, one-word domain names anyway? For a while British Gas advertised their online presence as <em><a href="http://www.house.co.uk">www.house.co.uk</a></em>, but these days it redirects to <em><a href="http://www.britishgas.co.uk">www.britishgas.co.uk</a></em>. Clearly trying to associate a well known brand with a tangentially related word didn’t work out. The exception might be offering email services: <em><a href="mailto:your.name@cheese.ai">your.name@cheese.ai</a></em> would be pretty cool, and <em><a href="http://hey.com">hey.com</a></em> is an obvious recent example - but again I don’t think many people are that bothered about their email address these days. For my job I have to review a lot of CVs, and I’m often surprised how many people who are clearly very qualified, have been in the industry for a while, yet have an email address with <em><a href="http://gmail.com">gmail.com</a></em> or <em><a href="http://hotmail.com">hotmail.com</a></em>. When a domain costs around £10 a year, it seems like a no-brainer to have your own domain for professional reasons - yet most people don’t.</p>
<p>So I’ve come to that conclusion that for most people domains do not matter. The web is now search-first. Gone are the days of meticulously typing <em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">http://www.bbc.co.uk</a></em> into your web browser and smashing down with great satisfaction on the enter key; for most people, their browser either suggests the site or a Google search does instead. If domains don’t matter, maybe I should start registering random strings instead? <em><strong><a href="http://mimcxsxuqibozfq.com">mimcxsxuqibozfq.com</a></strong></em> is it!</p>
